[Buffon's needle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffon's_needle)...

> ... ... Suppose you have a large sheet of paper on the floor, ruled with parallel straight lines spaced by a fixed distance. A needle of length equal precisely to the spacing between the lines is thrown completely at random onto the paper. What is the probability that the needle will land in such a way that it will intersect one of the lines? Surprisingly, the answer turns out to be the number 2/pi.

The number 666...

> The number you will obtain is a good approximation of the negative phi. Incidentally, President Ronald Reagan and Nancy Reagan changed their address in California from 666 St. Cloud Road to 668 to avoid the number 666...

> As we go further and further down, the Fibonacci sequence, the ratio of 2 successive Fibonacci numbers oscillates about, but comes closer and closer to the Golden Ratio.

a few intriguing examples of the great treasury of primes...

- the number 1234567891 which cycles through all the digits is a prime
- the 230th pargest prime, which has 6400 digits is composed of 6399 9s and only one 8
- the number composed of 317 iterations of the digit 1 is a prime.
