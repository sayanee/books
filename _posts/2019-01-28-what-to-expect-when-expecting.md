## First signs of pregnancy

- Breasts: tender, swollen, sensitive
- Spotting
- Fatigue
- Urinary frequency.
- Smell sensitivity
- Bloating: may be difficult to differentiate between a preperiod bloat and a pregnancy bloat
- Rising basal body temperature
- Missed period

How does home pregnancy test (HPT) work?

> All HPTs measure **urinary levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)**, a (developing) **placenta-produced hormone of pregnancy**. HCG finds its way into your bloodstream and urine almost immediately after an embryo begins implanting in the uterus, between **6 and 12 days after fertilization**.

When call your doctor?

> Still, medical follow-up to the test is essential. So **if the result is positive, it’s time to call your practitioner** and book that first prenatal appointment.

hCG increases with days

> Usually, if the first blood test given by your fertility specialist is positive, **it will be repeated in 2 to 3 days**. Why the repeat blood test? Your doctor will not only be looking to see that there’s hCG in your system, but also making sure the level of hCG increases by at least two-thirds (indicating that all is going well so far).

Scheduling ultrasound

> These blood tests will also measure hormones (like estrogen and progesterone) to make sure they are at the level they should be to sustain a pregnancy. If all 3 blood tests point to a pregnancy, then an ultrasound is scheduled around 5 to 8 weeks of pregnancy to **look for the heartbeat and a gestational sac**.

Late period of early miscarriage

> Unfortunately, it sounds like you may have experienced what’s known as a chemical pregnancy—when **an egg is fertilized, but for some reason never completes implantation**. Instead of turning into a viable pregnancy, it ends in a period. Though experts estimate that up to 70 percent of all conceptions are chemical, the vast majority of women who experience one don’t even realize they’ve conceived.

Calculation: LMP

> The 40 weeks of pregnancy are not counted from the day your baby was conceived—they’re counted from the first day of your last menstrual period (or LMP). Why start the clock on pregnancy before sperm even meets egg (and before your ovary even releases the egg)? The **LMP is simply a reliable day to date from**.

Matching the duration of the sperm (3-5 days) and the egg (up to 24 hours)

> That’s because sperm can hang out and **wait for an egg to fertilize up to 3 to 5 days after they’ve arrived through the vagina**, and an **egg can be fertilized up to 24 hours after it’s been released** — leaving a wider window than you might think.

In case the original doctor might be away during delivery

> Arranging to meet the covering practitioner ahead of time can help you feel more comfortable about that possibility.

What to look for during hospital selection?

> Does the hospital or birthing center offer a tub to labor in, a squat bar for pushing, a comfortable place for dad to room-in, plenty of space for family and friends to hang out in, a NICU? Is there flexibility about rules or procedures that concern you (say, eating or drinking during labor or routine IVs)?

Uterine fobroids?

> Chances are your fibroids won’t stand between you and an uncomplicated pregnancy. In fact, most often these **small nonmalignant growths on the inner walls of the uterus don’t affect a pregnancy at all**... even a large fibroid will move out of the baby’s way as the uterus expands during pregnancy.

1st trimester abortions / miscarriages

> Multiple first-trimester abortions aren’t likely to have an effect on future pregnancies. So if the **abortions were performed before the 14th week**, chances are there’s no cause for concern. Multiple second-trimester abortions (performed between 14 and 27 weeks), however, may slightly increase the risk of premature delivery.

Second-time pregnant

> You’ll “look pregnant” sooner. Thanks to abdominal and uterine muscles that are more lax (there’s no gentler way to put that), **you’re likely to “pop” much sooner than you did the first time**. You may notice, too, that your baby-number-2 bump looks different from your bump with baby number 1.

Prevention is better than cure

> Also keep this in mind: Even if the complications you faced last time have a chance of repeating no matter what prevention steps you take, **earlier detection and treatment** (because you and your practitioner will be on the lookout for a repeat) can make a big difference.

Dealing with miscarriages

> Trying to determine the cause of a single loss usually isn’t worthwhile, but a medical evaluation and esting will probably be recommended if you’ve had 2 or more consecutive miscarriages.

- Take the time you need.
- Feel the way you need to.
- Cry if you need to, for as long and as often as you feel you need to.
- Write about it.
- Let go of the guilt.
- Recognize that fathers grieve, too.
- Take care of each other.
- Don’t face the world alone. If you’re dreading the friendly faces
- Take care of yourself.
- Expect the pain to lessen over time.


Space out pregnancies for at least 18 months

> Getting the best prenatal care, starting as soon as you think you’re pregnant. Very closely spaced pregnancies (when there’s less than 12 months between pregnancies) increases the risk for preterm birth, though getting good prenatal care from the get-go can help reduce that risk.

Wean your first born

> Morning sickness can be a drain, literally—and that can deplete you of the nutrients and fluids necessary to nourish the baby that’s already here and the one that’s on the way. If nausea and vomiting are especially severe, and if you’re losing weight early on, discuss this challenge with your practitioner. You both might come to the conclusion that the best choice for all three of you (mom, baby, and baby-to-be) is to **wean your firstborn**.

What is unhealthy stress?

> Normal stress may keep you on your toes—let’s face it, even on the run—but it’s manageable, and you can thrive on it. Extreme stress, on the other hand, is unhealthy—it drains and debilitates you, **keeps you from sleeping well, keeps you from eating well, keeps you from enjoying life**.

Gum disease

> Some studies show that gum disease is associated with preterm delivery. Researchers suspect that the bacteria that cause inflammation in the gums can get into the bloodstream, reach the fetus, and initiate early delivery.

2nd trimester miscarriage

> An **incompetent cervix, one that opens prematurely** under the pressure of the growing uterus and fetus, is estimated to occur in 1 or 2 of every 100 pregnancies, and it is believed responsible for 10 to 20 percent of all second-trimester miscarriages.

After age 35

> Eliminate or minimize as many risk factors as you can, and you’ll be able to take years off your pregnancy profile—making your chances of delivering a healthy baby virtually as good as those of a younger mother. Yes, maybe even better. So relax, enjoy your pregnancy, and be reassured. There’s never been a better time to be over 35 and expecting a baby.


## Tests and vaccine

Rh factor

> All pregnant women are tested for the Rh factor early in pregnancy, usually at the first prenatal visit. If a mom-to-be turns out to be **Rh positive, as 85 percent of the population is, the issue of incompatibility isn’t an issue at all**. That’s because whether the baby is Rh positive or Rh negative, there are no foreign antigens on fetal red blood cells to cause mom’s immune system to mobilize against them.

Screening and test

> “Will my baby be healthy?” Time was, that question could be answered only after birth. Today, it can be answered as early as the first trimester, through a very wide variety of prenatal screening and diagnostic tests.

Document!

> Document your bump. Start every morning with a bump selfie.

Vaccines

> In the must-have department during pregnancy: The CDC recommends that every woman who is pregnant during flu season (generally October through April) receive a flu vaccine and that every pregnant woman get the Tdap vaccine (which protects the baby from diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis) between 27 and 36 weeks of pregnancy

Even low risk

> Most expectant moms (even those considered at low risk of having a baby with a defect) undergo several screening tests during their 40 weeks. That’s because **screening tests are noninvasive and increasingly accurate**.

Ultrasound

> For a **transabdominal early ultrasound**, your bladder must be full (which isn’t fun) so the still-small uterus can be seen more easily. Gel (some practitioners warm it up first, otherwise it’s chilly) is spread on your abdomen, and then the transducer wand is rubbed over it.

Fundal height

> At each prenatal visit, your practitioner checks your fundal height — the **distance from your pubic bone to the top of your uterus** —with a tape measure (see why the science isn’t so precise?). That number in centimeters is approximately equal to the number of weeks of pregnancy you are—but 1 or 2 centimeters in either direction is no big deal. In fact, a discrepancy of a couple of weeks (again, in either direction) is pretty typical because fundal height can be affected by many factors

Gestational diabetes

> Almost all practitioners screen for gestational diabetes (GD) in almost all expectant moms **at about 24 to 28 weeks**. Moms who are at higher risk for GD (including **older or obese mothers or those with a family history of diabetes**) are screened even earlier in their pregnancies.

## Workout, Sleep and relaxation

Temperature rises

> If you’ve always used strenuous workouts as a way to burn off extra calories you’ve eaten, it’s time to trade in that strategy for a healthier approach. Also **avoid any exercise that raises your temperature excessively**, which isn’t safe during pregnancy (**saunas and hot yoga are out**).

General advise

> Just to be sure, check in with your practitioner for the all-clear on your current workout regimen, and **ask before beginning a new one** (pregnancy isn’t the time to take on an extreme sport). Also, remember this mama-to-be mantra: **Listen to your body**. Don’t exercise until you drop . . . or until it hurts. Instead, **make moderation your pregnancy workout MO**.

Before sleeping

> **Light from the screen** alters sleepiness and alertness, and also **suppresses levels of melatonin**, the hormone that regulates your internal clock and plays a role in your sleep cycle. So power down your devices at least an hour before turning in.

Being positive!

> Women who are optimistic, not surprisingly, are more likely to take better care of themselves—**eating well, exercising right, getting regular prenatal care, and making good lifestyle choices**. And these positive behaviors—fueled by the power of positive thinking—can, of course, have a very positive effect on pregnancy and fetal wellbeing.

Not on the back

> Relax in the right position. It’s **best to avoid spending a lot of time on your back** after the 4th month... Stay off your back. After the 4th month, don’t exercise flat on your back. The weight of your enlarging uterus could compress major blood vessels, restricting circulation.

Essential oils to avoid

> The following essential oils are considered safe for prenatal massage, though experts recommend that they be mixed at a concentration that’s half the standard usage: **rose, lavender, chamomile, jasmine, tangerine, neroli, and ylang-ylang**. Pregnant women should particularly avoid the following oils, because some of them can trigger uterine contractions: basil, juniper, rosemary, sage, peppermint, pennyroyal, oregano, and thyme.

Manicure / Pedicure?

> Manicure and pedicure. It’s perfectly safe to polish while pregnant (and take advantage now, because it’s likely that your nails are growing faster and stronger than ever). If you get your nails done in a salon, **make sure it’s a well-ventilated one**

Try not to cross Legs

> Exercising regularly (to **improve circulation and leg strength**) and getting into the habit of **not crossing your legs** (which restricts blood flow) will also help keep spider veins at bay.

Moisturise

> Moisturize early and often (**while skin is still damp**, if you’re just out of the water) to **lock in the skin’s own moisture**. ■ Limit time in the water (especially very warm water). ■ **Try not to get too hot or sweaty**.

Watch posture at computer

> Straighten up. Slouching while at the computer or looking down to swipe on your tablet, scour baby gear sites, or do other close work for long stretches of time can also trigger an aching head, so watch your posture.

Kegel!

> Just **5 minutes of Kegels, 3 times a day**, and you’ll tone your way to a long list of both short- and long-term benefits. **Toned pelvic floor muscles** can ease a host of pregnancy and postpartum symptoms from hemorrhoids to urinary and fecal incontinence.

Many benefits of exercising

- tend to have shorter labors and are less likely to need labor and delivery interventions
- Your postpartum recovery
- babies of moms who exercise during pregnancy are born at healthier weights, are better able to weather labor and delivery (they’re less stressed by it), and recover from the stresses of birth more quickly
- Babies of pregnant exercisers, on average, tend to sleep through the night sooner, are less prone to colic, and are better able to soothe themselves

How much to sweat?

> A little sweat is fine, a **drenching sweat is a sign to slow down**. So is being unable to carry on a conversation as you go. Work hard enough so you feel yourself breathing more heavily, **but not so out of breath that you aren’t able to talk**, sing, or whistle while you work(out). Needing a nap after completing a workout means you’ve likely worked too hard. You **should feel energized, not drained, after exercising**.

Avoid abdomen exercises

> **Full sit-ups or double leg lifts pull** on the abdomen, so they’re probably not a good idea when you’ve got a baby on board. Also avoid any activity that requires “bridging” (bending over backward) or other contortions, or that involves deep flexion or extension of joints (such as deep knee bends), jumping, bouncing, sudden changes in direction, or jerky motions. Choosing the

Water aerobics

> the water, you **weigh just a tenth of what you do on land** (how often do you have the chance to be close to weightless these days?), making water workouts the perfect choice for a pregnant woman. Working out in the water boosts your strength and flexibility but is gentle on your joints—plus there’s much less risk of overheating

Barre classes

> Barre classes. These ballet-inspired workouts are great when you’re expecting because they include **lots of legwork with minimal jumping**. The **balance exercises and core strengthening** are pregnancy perfect, too, especially when your swelling belly slackens the core and throws you off balance.

Light weights are good!

> Weight training. Using weights can increase your muscle tone (and get your biceps ready for lifting baby), but it’s important to avoid heavy weights or those that require grunting or breath holding, which may compromise blood flow to the uterus. Use light weights with multiple repetitions instead.

Other exercises

- Dromedary Droop (or Cat/Cow Pose)
- Neck Relaxer. This exercise will ease tension in your neck.
- Pelvic Tilt
- Side Leg Lifts
- Biceps Curl.
- Tailor Stretch
- Clamming
- Squats
- Waist Twists
- Hip Flexors
- Chest Stretches
- Triangle Pose
- Forearm Plank with knees on floor

Posture

- Use a footrest to elevate your feet slightly
- Don’t cross your legs, which can cause your pelvis to tilt forward
- Don’t sit too long
- Try not to stand too long, either
- Be a slow lifter. Avoid lifting heavy loads, but if you must, do it slowly.
- Try to keep weight gain within the recommended parameters
- Wear the right shoes
- Sleep right
- When getting out of bed, swing your legs over the side of the bed to the floor

Be careful of over stretching due to relaxin

> Relaxin, the pregnancy hormone that **loosens the ligaments and joints around your pelvis** so your baby can fit through the exit, doesn’t discriminate between the ligaments you’d want loosened up (like those pelvic ones) and those you’d rather it just leave alone (like those in your feet). The result: When those ligaments in the feet loosen, the bones under them tend to spread slightly, often resulting in an added half or even a whole shoe size. Though the joints will tighten back up again after delivery, it’s possible that your feet will be permanently larger.

Sleeping position

> **Curling up or stretching out on your side**—preferably the left side, though either side is fine—with **one leg crossed over the other and with a pillow between them**, is ideal for both you and your baby-to-be. It not only allows maximum flow of blood and nutrients to the placenta but also enhances kidney function, which means better elimination of waste products and fluids and less swelling of ankles, feet, and hands.


## Food and nutrition

Smaller, more frequent and water

> To keep your symptoms manageable, stick to the techniques you’re used to using to combat IBS during other times in your life: Eat smaller, more frequent meals, stay well hydrated, avoid excess stress, and steer clear of foods or drinks that make your symptoms worse.

Maintain ideal weight gain

> Gaining too little weight can increase the chances your baby will be born early, but so can packing on too many pounds. Conceiving at your ideal body weight and gaining just the right number of pounds for your pregnancy profile can provide your baby with a healthier, more nurturing uterine environment and, ideally, a better chance of staying safely ensconced until term.

Take folate!

> A diet that lacks necessary nutrients (especially folate, the dietary version of folic acid) increases your risk for premature delivery, while a diet that’s nutrition packed decreases that risk.

Prenatal vitamin

> In the real world—the one you most likely live in—a prenatal supplement **provides extra health insurance** for you and your baby, covering those nutritional bases when your diet doesn’t. And that’s why taking one daily is recommended. Still, a supplement is just a supplement. **No pill (or powder), no matter how complete, can replace a good diet.**

What does too much caffeine do?

> Sure, caffeine has impressive pick-me-up powers, but in large doses it can **block the absorption of iron**. It can also act as a diuretic, causing calcium and other key pregnancy nutrients to be washed out of your system before they can be thoroughly absorbed—not to mention, **increasing urinary frequency**.


Usage of microwave is safe and fast!

> Microwave away, mom. All the research indicates that microwaves are completely safe to use during pregnancy (and at all other times). Just a couple of sensible precautions: Use only cookware that is specifically manufactured for use in the microwave (look for a **microwave-safe BPA-free container**), and **don’t let plastic wrap touch foods** during microwaving, covering food with an appropriate microwave-**safe top or with a paper towel** instead.

Food cleanliness

> **Wash fruits and vegetables**, especially those grown in home gardens, rinsing very thoroughly, and/or peel or cook them. ■ Don’t eat **raw or undercooked meat or unpasteurized milk** or dairy products. ■ **Wash your hands thoroughly after handling raw meat.**

Natural !== Safe

> Also important to keep in mind: Just because a product is natural doesn’t mean it’s safe. In fact, there are certain herbs that are known to be dangerous during pregnancy (and that might be lurking in herbal remedies without you even knowing). For instance, aloe, barberry, black cohosh, blue cohosh, dong quai, feverfew, goldenseal, juniper, and wild yam are **uterine stimulants and could potentially lead to miscarriage or premature contractions**.

Benefits of good pregnancy diet!

> The Pregnancy Diet can also increase the chances that you’ll have a **safe pregnancy** (some complications, such as anemia, gestational diabetes, and preeclampsia, are less common among women who eat well and avoid excess weight gain), a **comfortable pregnancy** (the right foods can minimize morning sickness, fatigue, heartburn, constipation, and a host of other pregnancy symptoms), **better balanced emotions** (good nutrition may help moderate those wild mood swings), a **full-term pregnancy** (in general, moms-to-be who eat regularly and well are less likely to deliver too early), and a **speedier postpartum recovery** (a well-nourished body can bounce back faster and more easily, and weight that’s been gained at a sensible rate can be shed more quickly).

How much more?

> But it’s important to remember that one of the two is a tiny developing fetus whose caloric needs are significantly lower than mom’s—a mere 300 on average a day... So, on average, **you now need only about 300 calories more a day** than you used to eat pre-pregnancy—the equivalent of 2 glasses of skim milk and a bowl of oatmeal.


Calories are not all the same!

> It may seem obvious—and inherently unfair—but those 200 calories in a donut are not equal to the 200 calories in a whole grain muffin. Also not equal: the 100 calories in a handful of potato chips and the 100 calories in a handful of almonds.

No skipping meals and snacks

> Starve yourself, starve your baby. Your baby needs regular nourishment at regular intervals—and as the sole caterer of your uterine cafe, only you can provide it. **Even if you’re not hungry, your baby is. So try not to skip meals.** ... Carry **trail mix, some freeze-dried fruit, nuts, a granola bar, or some whole-grain chips** in your bag for quick blood sugar lifts.


Meal planning

> Research shows that moms-to-be who eat at least 5 times a day (**3 meals plus 2 snacks** or **6 mini-meals**, for instance) are more likely to carry to term.

Legumes

> ¾ cup cooked beans, lentils, split peas, or chickpeas (garbanzos) ½ cup cooked edamame ¾ cup green garden peas 1½ ounces peanuts 3 tablespoons peanut or nut butter ¼ cup miso 4 ounces tofu (bean curd) 3 ounces tempeh 1½ cups soy milk* 3 ounces soy cheese* ½ cup vegetarian “ground beef”* 1 large veggie “hot dog” or “burger”* 1 ounce (before cooking) soy or high-protein pasta**

Grains

> whole wheat pasta ⅓ cup wheat germ ¾ cup oat bran 1 cup uncooked (2 cups cooked) oats 2 cups (approximately) whole grain ready-to-eat cereal* ½ cup uncooked (1½ cups cooked) bulgur, buckwheat, or whole wheat couscous ½ cup uncooked quinoa 4 slices whole grain bread** 2 whole grain pitas or English muffins**

Nuts and seeds

> walnuts, pecans, or almonds 2 ounces sesame, sunflower, or pumpkin seeds

Fruits and Vegetables

> Green Leafy and Yellow Vegetables and Yellow Fruit: ½ medium grapefruit ½ cup grapefruit juice ½ medium orange ½ cup orange juice 2 tablespoons juice concentrate ¼ cup lemon juice ½ medium mango ¼ medium papaya ⅛ small cantaloupe or honeydew (½ cup cubed) ⅓ cup strawberries ⅔ cup blackberries or raspberries ½ medium kiwi ½ cup diced fresh pineapple 2 cups diced watermelon ¼ cup freeze-dried mango, strawberries, or other vitamin C–rich fruit ¼ medium red, yellow, or orange bell pepper

DHA

> **Omega-3 fatty acids, most notably DHA**, are the best addition you can make to your diet when you’re eating for two. That’s because DHA is essential for proper **brain growth and eye development in fetuses** and young babies. In fact, researchers have found that toddlers whose moms consumed plenty of DHA during pregnancy had better hand-eye coordination than their peers, though it’s unclear if this translates to boosted brainpower later in childhood.

Not too much fo Vitamin A

> **No more than 4,000 IU (800 mcg) of vitamin A** (amounts over 10,000 IU could be toxic). Many manufacturers have reduced the amount of vitamin A in their vitamin supplements or have **replaced it with beta-carotene**, a much safer source of vitamin A.

Stock up on food

> Stock up with wholesome but satisfying snacks: fresh, dried, or freeze-dried fruit (try freezing grapes at home for a cold, sweet snack), nuts, healthy chips (baked soy, lentil, whole corn, kale, or other veggie varieties), whole grain granola or cereal bars and crackers, individual-size yogurts or smoothies, string cheese or wedges (or crunchy Moon Cheese).

Cooking

> Make the most of your main. Get your protein—fish, seafood, chicken breast, or beef—the lean way (good words to look for: **“grilled,” “broiled,” “steamed,” and “poached”**).

Fishes to eat

> Choose from **salmon (wild caught is best), sole, flounder, haddock, trout, halibut, ocean perch, pollack, cod, light canned tuna, catfish**, and other smaller ocean fish (**anchovies, sardines, and herring** are not only safe, but also loaded with omega-3s).

Canned Tuna is fine

> What about tuna, America’s favorite fish in a can? The EPA, the FDA, and ACOG all agree that canned light tuna is safe to eat because it’s not high in mercury.

Chillies and risk

> Hot mamas-to-be can continue testing their taste buds with **4-alarm chilis, salsas, stir-fries, and curries**. The only risk of eating spicy food during pregnancy is that **you’ll be following it up with indigestion**, especially later in pregnancy

Fermented food

> Are you sweet on **sauerkraut, crazy for kimchi, and nutty for natto**? Old favorites in many cultures, fermented foods like these (and many others, including **yogurt, kefir, tempeh, and miso**, to name a few) are new again—and they’re hitting the shelves with lots of health claims, too.

Homebrewed Kumbucha

> Keep in mind, too, that **unpasteurized kombucha** (particularly home-brewed varieties) can be contaminated with harmful bacteria and that some kombuchas contain alcohol (clearly a no-go when you’re expecting).

Tea

> Stick to **regular (black) tea** that comes flavored, or mix up your own by adding any of the following to boiling water or regular tea: orange, apple, pineapple, or other fruit juice; slices of lemon, lime, orange, apple, pear, or other fruit; mint leaves, **cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, or ginger (believed to be an effective calmer of the queasies)**.

Green tea?

> The jury’s still out on green tea, which can **decrease the effectiveness of folic acid**, that vital pregnancy vitamin—so if you’re a green tea drinker, drink in moderation.

Dark Chocolate

> Eating dark chocolate (the **higher the cocoa content**, the better) may help boost mood and reduce anxiety, too.

Healthy weight gain

> If your BMI is average (between 18.5 and 25), you’ll probably be advised to **gain between 12kg to 15kg**, the standard recommendation for the average-weight pregnant woman.

Off-limit medications

> Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) is pretty much off-limits when you’re expecting. Now the good news: You can find relief in acetaminophen (Tylenol), which is considered safe for occasional use during pregnancy

Eat a variety of food to avoid picky kids later!

> now that your **baby is swallowing amniotic fluid each day** (for hydration, nutrition, and also to get practice swallowing and digesting), he or she will be getting a virtual taste of—and a taste for—whatever’s on your menu.


## Morning sickness

Food to combat morning sickness

> Good choices include **ginger ale, soothing smoothies, and crackers** (but ask first—what spells r-e-l-i-e-f for one queasy woman spells v-o-m-i-t for another). Encourage her to eat **small meals throughout the day** instead of 3 large ones (spreading out the load and keeping her tummy filled may ease her nausea),

Don't run empty stomach

> **Eat early.** Morning sickness doesn’t wait for you to get up in the morning. In fact, nausea’s most likely to strike when you’re running on empty, as you are after a long night’s sleep... **Eat late.** Eating a light snack high in protein and complex carbs (a muffin and a glass of milk, string cheese and a handful of freeze-dried mango) just before you go to sleep will help ensure a happier tummy. **Eat light.** A stuffed tummy is just as prone to puking as an empty one. **Eat often.** One of the best ways to keep nausea at bay is to keep your blood sugar on an even keel—and your stomach a little filled—all the time. **Eat well.** A diet high in protein and complex carbohydrates can help combat queasiness.

Soothing food

> **Mint, lemon, ginger, and cinnamon** are more likely to be soothing, especially if you’re queasy, though some expectant moms suddenly embrace smells that invoke infants, such as baby powder.

Brush frequently

> Brushing your teeth frequently with a **minty toothpaste**, rinsing with a minty mouthwash, or chewing sugarless gum can help dry things... > Pack a toothbrush. If you’re suffering from morning sickness, brushing your teeth can protect them between bouts of vomiting—plus it helps **freshen up your breath** when it most needs freshening.

Lemon and prune

> Turn to warm liquids, including that spa staple, hot water and lemon. They’ll help stimulate peristalsis, those intestinal contractions that help you go. Truly tough cases may benefit from that geriatric favorite, prune juice.

Gas producers

> Steer clear of gas producers. Your tummy will tell you what they are. Common offenders beyond the notorious beans include onions, cabbage, fried foods, sugary sweets, and carbonated beverages.

Always keep a supply of snacks

> Eat regularly. To **avoid hunger headaches triggered by low blood sugar**, be sure not to run on empty. **Carry high-energy snacks** (such as lentil chips, granola bars, nuts, freeze-dried fruit) with you in your bag, stash them in the glove compartment of your car and in your office desk drawer, and always keep a supply on hand at home.

Yes, you can eat peanuts

> Good news: The latest research suggests that eating peanuts while pregnant not only doesn’t trigger peanut and other allergies in babies-to-be, but it may actually prevent them. So **as long as you’re not personally allergic to peanuts, there’s no need to skip** the Skippy—and maybe more reason than ever to reach for it. Ditto for dairy products or other highly allergenic foods. If you’re not allergic to them yourself (in which case you’d clearly want to steer clear), there’s no reason to avoid any allergenic foods during pregnancy.

## Other practices

Startling the fetus with mobile phone rings

> Experts suggest that you **avoid carrying your mobile on your waist** (or where your waist once was) and keep it on silent when it’s near your bump. Research shows that **fetuses startle when they hear that beeping or buzzing or ringing so close by**, possibly rattling their sleep-wake cycle.

Fumes

> Never (even when you’re not pregnant) **mix ammonia with chlorine-based products**. The combination produces deadly fumes.

Plants for air freshening

> Keep indoor air clean. The EPA recommends changing the **air filters on HVAC units** regularly. Another tip: Place potted plants around your home, since research shows they can actually suck up **irritating chemicals like formaldehyde**, leaving your air cleaner.

Exposure to sun

> While the body produces vitamin D when exposed to sunlight, making enough can be challenging—especially for those who have darker skin, live in less-sunny climates, don’t get outdoors enough, or wear sunscreen.

Read the small print in ingredients

> Labels aren’t designed to help you as much as to sell you. Keep this in mind when filling your shopping cart, and **learn to read the small print**, especially the ingredients list and the nutrition label (which is designed to help you). The ingredients listing will tell you, in order of predominance (with the first ingredient the most plentiful and the last the least), exactly what’s in a product.

Wash clothes and sponges

> Wash dishcloths frequently and keep sponges clean (replace them often, wash them in the dishwasher each night, or periodically pop dampened ones into the microwave for a couple of minutes), since they can harbor bacteria.

To announce or not?

> Some couples opt to **hold off on any announcements until the first trimester has passed**, and some keep the secret as long as they can—say, until the baby bump (or the sudden passing up of wine, or the ever-green look on her face)—starts making it obvious.

Expectations after announcements

> Just remember, once you share your happy news (or it becomes oh-so-obvious), people you know (and, yes, even those you don’t) will be more than **happy to share unsolicited advice**, comments about your weight, nightmare labor stories, and finger-wagging critiques of your morning latte—not to mention those belly rubs you didn’t ask for.

Saving time - order online!

> Order your groceries (and anything else you can think of) online instead of dragging yourself to the store. If it’s affordable for you, become a regular on the GrubHub or Seamless (or other food delivery services) circuit, and tap into TaskRabbit (or others like it) to outsource errands.

Wear supportive bra

> Sagging results not just from pregnancy itself but from a lack of support during pregnancy. No matter how perky your breasts are now, protect them from a floppy future by **wearing a supportive bra** (though in that tender first trimester, you may want to **avoid restrictive underwires**).

Wear support hose

> While wearing support hose probably won’t contribute to your sexiest pregnancy moment, it may **help by counteracting the downward pressure of your belly** and giving the veins in your legs a little extra upward push. Plus, support hose have come a long way in style and comfort since grandma’s day.

Hair removals

> Rather not wear fur? No need to. **You can safely turn to all of those hair removal old reliables: shaving, plucking, threading, and waxing**. Even a full-on Brazilian wax is fine—just proceed with care, since pregnancy skin can be super-sensitive and easily irritated.

Facials? hhmmm

> Most facials are safe during pregnancy, as long as they don’t incorporate any ingredients that might get the red light (such as retinoids or salicylic acid;

How to combat stretch marks

> You might be able to minimize, if not prevent, stretch marks by keeping **weight gain steady, gradual, and moderate** (the faster skin stretches, the more likely the stretching is to leave its mark)... And though no topical preparation has been proven to prevent stretch marks from zigzagging their way across your skin, there’s no harm in **applying pregnancy-safe moisturizers, such as cocoa or shea butter**.

Having sex while pregnant

> Explore different positions before that belly of yours makes many of them a physical impossibility. And most of all, enjoy that cozy twosome while you can (and before your libido takes its very likely postpartum nosedive)... **Side-lying positions (front-to-front or front-to-back, aka spooning) are often most comfortable** because they keep you off your back. Ditto **woman on top** (which allows you more control over penetration).


Always empty your bladder!

> Don’t hold it in. Emptying your bladder as needed (but at least every 2 hours) also **helps prevent UTIs** (Urinary Track Infections). A good strategy: **Plan to pee every hour or so**, whether you need to or not.

Go long for dresses

> It’s the oldest trick in the fashion book, but for good reason—it works. As you widen, choose clothes with vertical lines (which create height and give you a leaner look) instead of horizontal lines (which widen you even further).

Old wives' tales

> First of all, keep in mind that most of what you hear is probably nonsense. **Old wives’ tales that do have foundation in fact have been, for the most part scientifically substantiated and have become part of standard medical practice.** Those that do not might still be tightly woven into pregnancy mythology but can be confidently dismissed.

Dealing with "intelligent" non-scientific advise

> Politely inform the well-meaning stranger, friend, or relative that **you have a trusted practitioner who counsels you on your pregnancy** and that, even though you appreciate the thought, you can’t accept advice from anyone else. Or, just as politely, smile, say thank you, and go on your way, **letting their comments go in one ear and out the other**—without making any stops in between.

Why hair and nails' growth rate will be higher

> those same hormones are actually responsible for a substantial pregnancy perk: nails that grow faster than you can manicure them and hair that grows before you can secure appointments with your stylist (and if you’re really lucky, hair that is thicker and more lustrous). Those **pregnancy hormones trigger a surge in circulation and a boost in metabolism that nourish hair and nail cells**, making them healthier than ever before.

Eye sight might change

> Eye dryness, which is caused by a **hormone-induced decrease in tear production**, may be at least partially to blame for irritation and discomfort. Another cause is extra fluid (it’s everywhere!), that **can change the shape of eye lenses**—actually making some pregnant women **more near-or farsighted**. Your vision should clear up and your eyes return to normal after delivery

Avoid LASIK for 6 months

> In case you were thinking about it, now isn’t the time to consider corrective laser eye surgery. Though the procedure wouldn’t harm the baby, it **could overcorrect your vision and take longer to heal**, possibly requiring a second corrective surgery later on (plus the eye drops used aren’t recommended for pregnant women). Ophthalmologists recommend avoiding the surgery during pregnancy, in the **6 months preconception, and for at least 6 months postpartum (and if you’re nursing, 6 months postweaning)**.

Bonding via reading and music while in the womb

> Talking, reading, or singing to your baby while he or she is in the womb (no amplification necessary) won’t guarantee straight A’s (or faster ABCs), but **it will ensure that your baby will know your voice (and dad’s voice) at birth** — and will give you both a head start on bonding... So turn on the Mozart, bring on the Bach, pull out those dusty Shakespeare sonnets (or pull them up online), and read away to your belly if you like—and if you can without cracking up. Just make sure **you’re doing it all to get closer to your baby—not to get him or her closer to a spot in the school orchestra or an academic scholarship**.

Sharing too much online?

> Going public—or staying private—is a personal choice. If you do opt to showcase your baby bump and baby-to-be’s first pictures online, remember that **whatever you put online lives online forever**—and in this case **you’ve begun to build your little one’s digital footprint before he or she is even born**.


## Complications

Corpus luteum cyst

> So now that you know what a corpus luteum cyst is, you’re probably wondering—how will it affect my pregnancy? The answer: It probably won’t at all. The cyst is usually nothing to worry about—or do anything about. Chances are, **it will go away by itself in the second trimester**.

placenta previa

> Another reason not to worry: If you do end up being diagnosed with placenta previa, your baby will simply be delivered via a scheduled cesarean.

Group B strep (GBS)

> Group B strep (GBS) is a strain of bacteria that lives quietly in the vaginas of between 10 and 35 percent of healthy women—which makes them “carriers” of GBS (or GBS-positive)... And that’s why expectant moms are routinely tested for GBS—usually between 35 and 37 weeks (testing before 35 weeks isn’t accurate in predicting who will be carrying GBS at the time of delivery).

HG

> What is it? Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) is the medical term for **severe pregnancy nausea and vomiting that is continuous and debilitating** (not to be confused with typical morning sickness, even a pretty bad case). HG begins early in the first trimester (with a diagnosis usually coming about 9 weeks into pregnancy) and usually starts to lift between weeks 12 and 16.

Symptoms of HG

> What are the signs and symptoms? The symptoms of HG include: ■ Very frequent and severe nausea and vomiting (in other words, vomiting all day, every day) ■ The inability to keep any food or even liquid down (leading to malnutrition and electrolyte imbalance) ■ Signs of dehydration, such as infrequent urination or dark, scant urine ■ Weight loss of more than 5 percent ■ Blood in the vomit

Miscarriage

> Though it can be hard for parents to accept it at the time, when an early pregnancy loss occurs, it’s usually because the condition of the embryo or fetus wasn’t compatible with life. Early miscarriage is generally a natural selection process in which an **abnormal embryo or fetus (defective because of genetic abnormality, poor implantation in the uterus, maternal infection, random accident, or other, unknown reasons)** is lost because it is incapable of survival.

## First trimester

Mild period like cramp

> Don’t worry. A feeling of pressure or even **mild crampiness without bleeding is very common**, especially in first pregnancies—and is usually a sign that everything’s going right, not that something’s going wrong.

Spotting

> So if you’re noticing only light spotting—similar to what you see at the beginning or end of your period—you can take a deep breath and read on for a probable (and probably reassuring) explanation. Such light spotting is usually caused by one of the following: Implantation of the embryo.

First heartbeats

> If you’re past the 6th week, you’ll probably be able to see your baby’s heartbeat during the ultrasound, which will reassure you that your pregnancy is progressing along just fine, even with the spotting.

Massage?

> Wait for your rub. Massage during the first 3 months of pregnancy **may trigger dizziness and add to morning sickness**, so it’s best to hold off until the second trimester.

Common to have indigestion

> It’s nearly impossible to have an indigestion-free 9 months—tummy troubles come with the pregnant territory.

- Avoid spicy and highly seasoned foods, fried or fatty foods, processed meats, chocolate, coffee, carbonated beverages, and mint
- Take it small: The 6-Meal Solution is ideal for heartburn and indigestion sufferers
- Keep it up: It’s harder for gastric juices to back up when you’re vertical than when you’re horizontal
- Keep it loose. Don’t wear clothing that’s tight around your belly or waist
- Add almonds. Eat a few almonds after each meal, since these tasty nuts neutralize the juices in the stomach, which may relieve or even prevent heartburn

Prominent veins

> Not only are these veins (which can make your chest and belly look like a road map) normal and nothing to worry about, but they are a sign that your body is doing what it should. They’re **part of the network of veins that has expanded to carry the increased blood supply of pregnancy**, which will be nourishing your baby.

Bloaty Gassy Clogged up

> Irregularity—that bloated, gassy, clogged-up feeling—is a very regular pregnancy complaint. And there are good reasons why. For one, the **high levels of progesterone** circulating in your expectant system **cause the smooth muscles of the large bowel to relax**, making them sluggish and allowing food to hang around longer in the digestive tract.


## 2nd trimester

Weight gain

> During the second trimester, your baby’s getting bigger, which means your weight gain quota will grow, too—picking up to an average rate of about **1 to 1½ pounds per week during months 4 through 6** (totaling 12 to 14 pounds)... Check, too, if you gain no weight for more than 2 weeks in a row during the 4th to 8th months

Symptoms

> With the start of the second trimester, some symptoms may be tapering off, others intensifying: Physically ■ Fatigue ■ Decreasing urinary frequency ■ An end to, or a decrease in, nausea and vomiting (for a few women, morning sickness will continue—for a very few, it is just beginning) ■ Constipation ■ Heartburn, indigestion, flatulence, bloating ■ Continued breast enlargement, but usually decreased tenderness

Vaginal discharge is normal

> A **thin, milky, mild-smelling discharge** (known in the ob business as leukorrhea) is normal throughout pregnancy. Its purpose is noble: to **protect the birth canal from infection and maintain a healthy balance of bacteria in the vagina**.

Fetal kicks are normal

> After the 28th week, **fetal movements become more consistent, and it’s a good idea** to get into the habit of checking on your baby’s activity daily.

To know the gender or not?

> Some parents opt for a heads-up on baby’s gender for practical reasons: It makes **layette shopping, nursery painting, and name selection** (only one to pick!) a lot easier.

Travel time! Babymoon

> When you’re planning pregnancy travel, timing it right is the ticket—with the mostly easygoing second trimester typically travel-friendliest... Have medical backup. If you’re traveling far, **have the name of a local ob handy**, just in case.

What to pack for the travel

> Pack a pregnancy survival kit. Make sure you take **enough prenatal vitamins to last the trip, some healthy snacks**, Sea-Bands if you’re susceptible to motion sickness, and a medication for traveler’s stomach recommended by your practitioner. Something to leave out of your kit: jet lag remedies (including melatonin) that aren’t practitioner-approved.

Avoid high altitude

> But altitude-induced pregnancy problems (such as hypertension, water retention, a somewhat smaller-than-average baby) **can occur in women who have just moved to a high-altitude area after a lifetime at sea level**.

## 3rd trimester

Baby's skin

> window into your womb would reveal that your **baby’s skin is a bit saggy**, hanging loosely from that little body. That’s because **skin grows faster than fat develops**, and there’s not much fat to fill that skin out yet. But don’t worry—the fat is about to start catching up... Right now, the organs and bones can still be seen through the skin, which has a red hue thanks to the developing veins and arteries just underneath. But **by month 8, no more see-through baby**!

Feeling the kicks

> So when you’re on the go all day, your baby is likely to be pacified by the rhythm of your routine, and **you’re likely not to notice much kicking—partly because baby has slowed down, partly because you’re so busy**. As soon as you slow down or relax, your little one’s bound to start acting up (a pattern babies tend to continue even after they’re born). That’s why **you’re more apt to feel fetal movement in bed at night or when you’re resting** during the day.

Spotting or bleeding

> Still, it’s important to let your practitioner know about any spotting or bleeding because it could also be a **sign of preterm delivery, placental abruption**, or another serious condition. If you’re bleeding heavily or if the spotting is accompanied by pain or discomfort, call your practitioner right away.

Baby's head acts like a cork

> If you do end up being among the 15 percent who spring a **prelabor leak**, you’ll probably notice the tell-tale gush or trickle more if you’re lying down than if you’re standing up. That’s because when you’re upright (standing, walking, even sitting), your **baby’s head acts like a cork in a bottle, blocking the opening of the uterus and keeping most of the amniotic fluid in**.

Place something while sleeping

> You also might want to place heavy towels, a plastic sheet, or hospital bed pads under your sheets in the last few weeks, just in case your water breaks in the middle of the night.

Normal amount of kicks

> **Ten or more movements during each 1 to 2 hour test period** (squirms and wriggles count, but not hiccups) mean that your baby’s activity level is normal.

Discussion with your doctor

> How far along in labor should you be before calling your practitioner? Should you call if your water breaks? How can you make contact if the contractions start outside of regular office hours? Should you call first and then head for the hospital or birthing center? Or the other way around? Don’t wait until labor starts to get the answers to these important questions. Discuss all of these and other labor logistics with your practitioner at your next appointment

## Labour and childbirth

Yes painful, but it's normal

> But it’s important to keep in mind the following: **Childbirth is a normal life process**, which women have been experiencing as long as there have been women. Sure, it comes with pain, but it’s a pain with a positive purpose (though it won’t necessarily feel positive when you’re in it): to thin and open your cervix, and bring your baby into your arms.

Go for course / workshop

> Get educated. A good **childbirth education class can ease your anxiety** (and ultimately pain) by increasing knowledge, preparing you and your coach, stage by stage and phase by phase, for labor and delivery. If you can’t take a class or if you just don’t want to, read up on childbirth as much as you can.

A good course

> A comprehensive class should also cover **postpartum care, basic newborn care, and breastfeeding**. Most classes will enlighten you about birth plans, doulas, hospital births versus delivering in a birthing center or at home, and medical interventions (such as a c-section or induction) that could (but probably won’t) be necessary. Be sure to find out, too, if the course covers natural ways to reduce or cope with pain (such as massage, acupressure, aromatherapy, or using a birthing ball) as well as provides an overview of pain-relief options.

Things to know:

- infant CPR and first aid
- **Lamaze** approach to childbirth education is probably the most widely used in the U.S.
- **Bradley** most graduates don’t use pain medication during a vaginal delivery
- **Alexander** Technique focuses on countering your body’s natural tendency to tense up during pain
- birth plan

Make a good birth plan

> Not only can a good birth plan **deliver a better birth experience, but it can also head off unrealistic expectations, minimize disappointment**, and eliminate major conflict and miscommunication between a birthing mom and her birth attendants.

Water birth precautions

> For several reasons, however, **a baby’s underwater entry should be limited to no more than a few moments (10 seconds is the norm in the U.S.)**. First, because the umbilical cord can tear, cutting off the baby’s oxygen lifeline unexpectedly. Second, because **once the placenta separates from the uterus—which can happen at any time after delivery—it can no longer provide the baby with sufficient oxygen**.

Epidural

> Epidural. **A full two-thirds of women delivering at hospitals choose to relieve their labor pain with an epidural**. Why do so many laboring moms request the epidural by name? For one, it’s an extremely safe way to net good pain relief—only a small amount of medication is needed to achieve the desired effect, and the drug barely reaches the bloodstream

Cons of anesthesia

> The major downside to general anesthesia (besides the fact that mom has to miss the birth) is that it **sedates the baby along with the mother**. The medical team will minimize those sedative effects by administering the anesthesia as close to the actual birth as possible. That way the baby can be delivered before the anesthetic has reached him or her in amounts large enough to have an effect.

No judging please

> But the truth is—and it’s a truth that really deserves to go viral—**there’s room for every safe childbirth choice in the birthing room, but there should be no room for judging**. Every mom and dad, every labor, **every situation is different**—and what works for one doesn’t necessarily fly with the next. The bottom line that matters, as always, is **a healthy mom-and-baby bottom line**—and any choice or circumstance that delivers a safe delivery is a good one.

Beginning of Labour

> You’ll know that the contractions of prelabor have been replaced by true labor if: ■ The **contractions intensify**, rather than ease up, with activity and **aren’t relieved by a change in position**. ■ Contractions become **progressively more frequent and painful**

Positions for delivery

- Leaning over
- Squatting

> A **semi-sitting or semi-squatting position** is often the best because it enlists the **aid of gravity** in the birthing process and may offer you more pushing power. **Tucking your chin to your chest** when you’re in this position will help you focus your pushes where they need to be.

How long to wait before cutting the cord?

> Many midwives routinely wait until the cord stops pulsating, which can take several minutes, often more. The World Health Organization (WHO) already recommends waiting 1 to 3 minutes after birth to cut the umbilical cord.

3 stages for completion

> Childbirth progresses in 3 stages: **labor, delivery of the baby, and delivery of the placenta**. First up (unless a planned c-section eliminates this stage entirely) is labor, which is divided into three phases: early labor, active labor, and transitional labor.

Don't worry about poop and pee

> **Involuntary pooping (or peeing) is experienced by nearly everyone during delivery**. No one else in the room will think twice about it, and neither should you (you probably won’t even notice it). **Pads will immediately whisk away anything that comes out.**

What to eat and drink

> But don’t eat heavily, and avoid hard-to-digest foods (burgers, potato chips, pizza). You may also want to skip anything acidic, such as orange juice or lemonade. And definitely drink some water—it’s important to stay hydrated.

Skin contact

> In case you need a reason to do that, studies show that infants who have **skin-to-skin contact with their mothers just after delivery sleep longer and are calmer hours later**.

Vaginal bacteria

> Babies born vaginally pass through (and come out covered with) lots of bacteria-filled vaginal fluid. Studies show that these vaginal microbes are beneficial, helping to **shape a newborn’s immune system** and possibly even **reducing the risk of immune diseases (like asthma) later in life**.

Display of rows of babies are no longer the norm

> Wondering where all the babies at your local hospital went (you know, the neatly wrapped bundles that used to be on display in the nursery, in row after row of bassinets)? They’re rooming-in with their moms, most likely. **Full-time rooming-in has become the standard in family-centered maternity care**, and for a lot of very sound reasons.

## After the birth

Vaginal flow for the next few weeks

> Maxipads, not tampons, should be used to absorb the flow, which may continue on and off for just a couple of weeks or for as long as 6 weeks.

- **Preterm**. A baby born between 20 weeks and 37 weeks is considered preterm.
- **Early Term**. If your baby is born between 37 weeks 0 days and 38 weeks 6 days
- **Full Term**. Babies born between 39 weeks 0 days and 40 weeks 6 days
- **Late Term**. Arrival at between 41 weeks 0 days and 41 weeks 6 days.
- **Post-term**. Babies born after 42 weeks 0 days.

Breastfeeding

> Finally, if you’re planning to breastfeed, try to **get started as soon as possible after birth (ideally within 30 minutes) and feed every 2 to 3 hours** to prevent hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). To play it safe, babies of diabetic moms are usually not discharged from the hospital until they are maintaining blood glucose levels and feeding well.

Cutting cost

> But there are plenty of ways to cut those costs, including opting for **breastfeeding (no bottles or formula to buy) and accepting all the hand-me-downs that are offered** (new clothes start to look like hand-me-downs after a few spitting-up episodes anyway).

To save the cord or not?

> As of now, studies show that the **likelihood that a child will ever tap into his or her own saved cord blood later is very low** (1 in 2,700 to 1 in 20,000 by some estimates). In fact, experts point out that a **baby’s own cord blood cells are often unsuitable for treating a condition** that shows up later in the child’s life (like leukemia), because the mutations ultimately responsible for the condition are present at birth, and can be found in those cells.

Possibility of donating the umbilical cord?

> First, know that the decision you’ve made might save a life someday. Cord blood contains stem cells that can treat a host of diseases, and most major medical organizations (including the AAP) **encourage public donation of umbilical-cord blood cells so they can be used for actual transplants or for valuable medical research**—a far better option than letting that precious cord blood be thrown away.

Eating placenta - nope!

> There are **no clinical trials or scientific research to back the effectiveness** of these placenta preparations, and **most medical experts are skeptical about the perks of eating the afterbirth**. They point out that the touted benefits may be the result of a placebo effect

Don't try to be a supermom and be a hero

> **If baby, spouse, and job are priorities, perhaps keeping the house clean will have to take a (messy) backseat**. Maybe home cooked will sometimes give way to home delivered, or the laundry basket will become someone else’s responsibility.

Decisions and judgements from others

> **Breast or bottle? Stay-at-home or back-to-work? Baby-wearing or strollers? Separate sleep or co-sleep?** And you’ve probably also noticed that these and other hot button topics capture a lot of social media attention, the good, the bad, and especially, the judgey.

Recovery

> Keep off it. To keep the pressure off your sore perineum, lie on your side when possible, and avoid long periods of standing or sitting. Sitting on a pillow (especially one with an opening in the center, like a Boppy) or an inflated or memory foam donut cushion can help.

Take it easy

> The truth is, giving birth makes you a mother, but it doesn’t necessarily make you feel like one. Only time spent on this sometimes bewildering, sometimes overwhelming, always amazing job will do that. The day-to-day (and night-to-night) of parenting is never easy, but it absolutely, positively gets easier.

And babies doesn't judge your mistakes

> Best of all, since your baby’s never had another mom (or dad) to compare you with, you definitely stack up really well in his book. In fact, you’re the best he’s ever had.

Keep track

> And speaking of keeping track, it’s a good idea to **keep a running tab of baby’s feeds** (when they begin and end) as well as of wet and soiled diapers your newborn produces. While that might sound a bit obsessive, it’ll **help give you a good sense of how breastfeeding is going**, and also make it possible for you to **report back to baby’s doctor** at the next checkup.

Why hair fall will increase after giving birth

> Ordinarily, the **average head sheds 100 hairs a day** (just not all at once, so you don’t usually notice the shedding), and those hairs are being continually replaced. During pregnancy, however, **hormonal changes keep those hairs from falling out**, which means your head hangs on to them.

Healthy weight lose

> The fact is, no one comes out of the delivery room looking all that much slimmer than when they went in. Part of the reason for that protruding postpartum belly is your **still-enlarged uterus**, which will be reduced to prepregnancy size and relocated to its previous pelvic position by the **end of 6 weeks**, shrinking your girth in the process.

Wearing baby

> Wearing your baby makes your baby happier. Babies who are worn more cry less and sleep and feed better—and what could make a new parent happier (and more confident) than that? ... Wearing your baby **leaves your arms and legs free** — free to eat a meal, catch up on work, get the laundry done, and yes, even do your hair (your hair!). All of which can make you feel better.

Sex

> A 4-week wait (at least) for sex. The guidelines are pretty much the same as they are for those who’ve delivered vaginally

Period will start again

> In moms who aren’t nursing, periods usually kick in again between 6 and 12 weeks after delivery, **while in nursing moms the average is between 4 and 6 months**. As usual, however, averages don’t tell the whole story.

## Breastfeeding

Nutrition in breast milk

> It’s custom made. Tailored to meet the nutritional needs of human infants, breast milk **contains at least 100 ingredients that aren’t found in cow’s milk and that can’t be precisely replicated in commercial formulas**. And unlike formula, the **composition of breast milk changes constantly** to meet a baby’s ever-changing needs: It’s different in the morning than it is in the late afternoon, different at the beginning of a feeding than at the end, **different the 1st month than the 7th, and different for a preemie than for a full-term newborn**.

Infection prevention for both mom and baby

> It’s an infection preventer. With each and every feeding, nursers get a healthy dose of antibodies to boost their immunity to bugs of all varieties (which is why breastfeeding is sometimes referred to as a baby’s first immunization). In general, **breastfed babies come down with fewer colds, ear infections, lower respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, and other illnesses** than formula-fed infants, and when they do get sick, they’ll usually recover more quickly and with fewer complications.

Brain development

> It’s a brain booster. Breastfeeding, according to some evidence, appears to slightly increase a child’s IQ, at least through age 15, and possibly beyond. This may be related not only to the **brain-building fatty acids (DHA) in breast milk**, but also to the **closeness and mother-baby interaction that is built into breastfeeding**, which is believed to nurture a newborn’s intellectual development.

Less picky food habits

> Researchers have found that nursed babies are less likely to be timid in their tastes than their formula-fed peers once they graduate to the high chair—which means they may be more likely to open wide to that spoonful of yams (or that forkful of curried chicken) later on.

Speedy recovery for the mother

> Speedier postpartum recovery. It’s only natural that breastfeeding is best for newly delivered moms, too—after all, it’s the natural conclusion to the pregnancy-childbirth cycle. It’ll **help your uterus shrink back to prepregnancy size more quickly**, which in turn will reduce your flow of lochia (the postpartum bloody discharge), decreasing blood loss.

Other health benefits for mother

> Health benefits for mom. Plenty of perks here: Women who breastfeed have a **slightly lower risk of developing uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, and premenopausal breast cancer**.

Colostrum

> Colostrum. You already have this **thick clearish-yellow premilk** at the ready as soon as baby is born—providing your cuddly cutie with **crucial antibodies** and just the right kind of nourishment for the first few days of life.

Keep bottle-free

> Once you get home, stay bottle-free (even if you’ll ultimately be supplementing) **until breastfeeding is well established, usually at 2 to 3 weeks.**

Feeding schedule

> Feed around the clock. Aim for a **feeding every 2 to 3 hours**, timed from the beginning of one to the beginning of the next—for **a total of 8 to 12 feeds per day**.

For fathers and other family members

> Be your baby’s backup feeder. **Once breastfeeding is established**, there’s more than one way to feed a baby. And though you can’t breastfeed, you can be the one to give supplementary bottles of expressed milk or formula (if those will be on baby’s menu).

Getting some sleep

> **Sleep when the baby sleeps**. Yes, you’ve heard it before, and probably snorted at the thought. After all, baby’s naptime is the only time you can tackle the 300 other things that never seem to get done. But stop snorting and start snoring.

Start exercising slowly...

> Finally, exercise can make you happier. As exercise-released endorphins circulate in your system, boosting your mood and your ability to cope, you’ll find yourself much better equipped to handle the stresses of new parenthood, and even beat back baby blues.
