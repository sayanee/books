- **Book Title**: The Richest Man in Babylon
- **Author**:George S. Clason
- **Year written/published**: 1926
- **Summary**: This book is in a story form set in the scene of the ancient Babylon.
- **My Comments**: I found this book really different from other technical Finance books. I loved the way the concept was being simplified through gold coins and of course we have to relate it back to modern currency and stock systems. I read it like a thin short story book and it was enjoyable… had to read it slowly coz of the ‘ancient’ English.

5 laws of Gold: >

1. Gold cometh gladly and in increasing quantity to any man who will put by not less than 1/10 of his earnings to create an estate for his future and that of family
2. Gold laboreth diligently and contentedly for the wise owner who finds for it profitable employment, multiplying even as the flocks of the field.
3. Gold clingeth to the protection of the cautious owner who invests it under the advice of wise men in its handling
4. Gold slippeth away from the man who invests it in businesses or purposes with which he is not familiar or which are not approved by those skilled in its keep
5. Gold flees the man who would force it to impossible earnings or who followeth the allurance advice of tricksters and schemers or who trust it to his own inexperience and romantic desires in investment
