Why did anyone who's been through the holocaust even survived is the bigger question

> Clearly, many prisoners who desperately wanted to live did die, some from disease, some in the crematoria. But Frankl’s concern is less with the question of why most died than it is with the question of **why anyone at all survived**.

Life is a quest for meaning

> Life is not primarily a quest for pleasure, as Freud believed, or a quest for power, as Alfred Adler taught, but a quest for meaning.

Meaning from work, love and courage

> Frankl saw three possible sources for meaning: in **work (doing something significant)**, in **love (caring for another person)**, and in courage during difficult times.

## Inside the concentration camp

Sometimes, the best people did not return alive from these concentrations camps

> We who have come back, by the aid of many lucky chances or miracles — whatever one may choose to call them — we know: **the best of us did not return**.

Mental reactions periods

> three phases of the inmate’s mental reactions to camp life become apparent: the period following his **admission**; the period when he is well entrenched in **camp routine**; and the period following his **release and liberation**.

Fate was known to them as well

> There was another group of prisoners who got liquor supplied in almost unlimited quantities by the SS: these were the men who were employed in the gas chambers and crematoriums, and who knew very well that one day they would be relieved by a new shift of men, and that **they would have to leave their enforced role of executioner and become victims themselves**.

Nothing remained

> While we were waiting for the shower, o**ur nakedness was brought home to us: we really had nothing now except our bare bodies** — even minus hair; all we possessed, literally, was our naked existence. What else remained for us as a material link with our former lives?

One can get used to any condition

> If someone now asked of us the truth of Dostoevski’s statement that flatly defines man as a being who can get used to anything, we would reply, **“Yes, a man can get used to anything, but do not ask us how.”**

Optimists

> Many times, hopes for a speedy end to the war, which had been fanned by optimistic rumors, were disappointed. Some men lost all hope, **but it was the incorrigible optimists who were the most irritating companions**.

Judgement

> No man should judge unless he asks himself in absolute honesty whether in a similar situation he might not have done the same.

Avoid attention

> But at other times it was a very conscious effort on our part—in conformity with one of the camp’s most **imperative laws of self-preservation: Do not be conspicuous**. We tried at all times to avoid attracting the attention of the SS.

Cannibalism

> He related to me how he, as camp policeman, had searched for a piece of human flesh that was missing from a pile of corpses. He confiscated it from a pot in which he found it cooking. Cannibalism had broken out. I had left just in time.

Inferiority complex

> The majority of prisoners suffered from a kind of inferiority complex. We all had once been or had fancied ourselves to be “somebody.” Now we were treated like complete nonentities.

Miniature sense of grandeur even among prisoners

> The more “prominent” prisoners, the Capos, the cooks, the store-keepers and the camp policemen, did not, as a rule, feel degraded at all, like the majority of prisoners, but on the contrary—promoted! Some even developed miniature delusions of grandeur.

Violence increases with more violence

> Since the prisoner continually witnessed scenes of beatings, the impulse toward violence was increased. I myself felt my fists clench when anger came over me while I was famished and tired.

Apathy

> The experiences of camp life show that man does have a choice of action. There were enough examples, often of a heroic nature, which proved that apathy could be overcome, irritability suppressed.

## Lessons

Everything can be taken, but

> They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms — **to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances**, to choose one’s own way.

Who you become = inner decisions + external influences

> Even though conditions such as lack of sleep, insuffcient food and various mental stresses may suggest that the inmates were bound to react in certain ways, in the final analysis it becomes clear that **the sort of person the prisoner became was the result of an inner decision, and not the result of camp influences alone.**

Life is suffering - Buddha

> Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death. **Without suffering and death human life cannot be complete.**

Achievement only through suffering

> Everywhere man is confronted with fate, with the **chance of achieving something through his own suffering.**

Death and goal

> The Latin word finis has two meanings: the end or the finish, and a goal to reach. A man who could not see the end of his “provisional existence” was not able to aim at an ultimate goal in life. He ceased living for the future, in contrast to a man in normal life.

Living in the past

> A man who let himself decline because he could not see any future goal found himself occupied with retrospective thoughts.

Even in camp, there is an opportunity

> But **in robbing the present of its reality there lay a certain danger**. It became easy to overlook the opportunities to make something positive of camp life, opportunities which really did exist.

False hope is a great dissappointment

> The death rate in the week between Christmas, 1944, and New Year’s, 1945, increased in camp beyond all previous experience. In his opinion, the explanation for this increase did not lie in the harder working conditions or the deterioration of our food supplies or a change of weather or new epidemics. It was simply that the **majority of the prisoners had lived in the naïve hope that they would be home again by Christmas**.

Suffering

> When a man finds that it is his destiny to suffer, he will have to accept his suffering as his task; his single and unique task. He will have to acknowledge the fact that even in suffering he is unique and alone in the universe.

Hope

> said that each of us had to ask himself what irreplaceable losses he had suffered up to then. I speculated that for most of them these losses had really been few. Whoever was still alive had reason for hope. Health, family, happiness, professional abilities, fortune, position in society —all these were things that could be achieved again or restored.

When freedom was achieve, you couldn't even grasp it

> But we limped on; we wanted to see the camp’s surroundings for the first time with the eyes of free men. “Freedom”—we repeated to ourselves, and yet we could not grasp it.

Revenge

> Now, being free, they thought they could use their freedom licentiously and ruthlessly. The only thing that had changed for them was that they were now the oppressors instead of the oppressed. They became instigators, not objects, of willful force and injustice. They justified their behavior by their own terrible experiences.

Nobody should do wrong

> Only slowly could these men be guided back to the commonplace truth that no one has the right to do wrong, **not even if wrong has been done to them**.

## Therapy

> Logotherapy focuses rather on the future, that is to say, on the meanings to be fulfilled by the patient in his future. (Logotherapy, indeed, is a meaning-centered psychotherapy.)

Conflicts

> Not every conflict is necessarily neurotic; some amount of conflict is normal and healthy.


Tension = mental health

> Thus it can be seen that **mental health is based on a certain degree of tension, the tension between what one has already achieved and what one still ought to accomplish**, or the gap between what one is and what one should become.

But tensionless state is not a desire

> What man actually needs is not a tensionless state but rather the striving and struggling for a worthwhile goal, a freely chosen task. What he needs is not the discharge of tension at any cost but the call of a potential meaning waiting to be fulfilled by him.

How does one know what to do?

> No instinct tells him what he has to do, and no tradition tells him what he ought to do; sometimes he does not even know what he wishes to do. Instead, he either wishes to do what other people do (conformism) or he does what other people wish him to do (totalitarianism).

Self-actualization

> What is called self-actualization is not an attainable aim at all, for the simple reason that the more one would strive for it, the more he would miss it.

How can one discover meaning in life?

> According to logotherapy, we can discover this meaning in life in three different ways: (1) by creating a work or doing a deed; (2) by experiencing something or encountering someone; and (3) by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering.

Tremendous suffering not required to find meaning

> But let me make it perfectly clear that **in no way is suffering necessary to find meaning**. I only insist that meaning is possible even in spite of suffering—provided, certainly, that the **suffering is unavoidable**.

Man is... full of dimensions and varieties

> After all, man is that being who invented the gas chambers of Auschwitz; however, he is also that being who entered those gas chambers upright, with the Lord’s Prayer or the Shema Yisrael on his lips.

Tragic triad

> “tragic triad,” as it is called in logotherapy, a triad which consists of those aspects of human existence which may be circumscribed by: (1) pain; (2) guilt; and (3) death.

But how to turn around tragedy?

> an optimism in the face of tragedy and in view of the human potential which at its best always allows for: (1) turning suffering into a human achievement and accomplishment; (2) deriving from guilt the opportunity to change oneself for the better; and (3) deriving from life’s transitoriness an incentive to take responsible action.

dealing with aggressions

> aggressions only subsided when the youngsters dedicated themselves to a collective purpose—that is, the joint task of dragging out of the mud a carriage in which food had to be brought to their camp. Immediately, they were not only challenged but also united by a meaning they had to fulfill.

Addiction and meaning in life

> Annemarie von Forstmeyer who noted that, as evidenced by tests and statistics, **90 percent of the alcoholics she studied had suffered from an abysmal feeling of meaninglessness**. Of the drug addicts studied by Stanley Krippner, 100 percent believed that “things seemed meaningless.”

## How to find meaning in life

Study the life of others before you

> And how does a human being go about finding meaning? As Charlotte Bühler has stated: “All we can do is study the lives of people who seem to have found their answers to the questions of what ultimately human life is about as against those who have not.”

Where to find meaning? Creating, Service, Experiences

> As logotherapy teaches, there are three main avenues on which one arrives at meaning in life. The first is by **creating a work or by doing a deed**. The second is by **experiencing something or encountering someone**; in other words, meaning can be found not only in work but also in love.

Breaking other parts of mind and body cannot break you totally

> The attitude that I adopted on that fateful day has become my personal credo for life: I broke my neck, it didn’t break me.

Collective guilt is not useful

> As for the concept of collective guilt, I personally think that it is totally unjustified to hold one person responsible for the behavior of another person or a collective of persons.

## Victor Frankl

In theory and experience

> It is important to note that Frankl’s imprisonment was not the only impetus for Man’s Search for Meaning. **Before his deportation, he had already begun to formulate an argument that the quest for meaning is the key to mental health and human flourishing**. As a prisoner, **he was suddenly forced to assess whether his own life still had any meaning**.

Renounce the idea of collective guilt

> He also believed strongly in reconciliation rather than revenge; he once remarked, “I do not forget any good deed done to me, and I do not carry a grudge for a bad one.” Notably, he renounced the idea of collective guilt.

Even the most evil can change

> Instead, he was deeply committed to the idea that even a vile Nazi criminal or a seemingly hopeless madman has the potential to transcend evil or insanity by making responsible choices.

Social friendship

> He also valued his personal relationships with philosophers as radically different as Martin Heidegger, a reformed Nazi sympathizer, Karl Jaspers, an advocate of collective guilt, and Gabriel Marcel, a Catholic philosopher and writer.

Frankl's own meaning of life

> Frankl was once asked to express in one sentence the meaning of his own life. He wrote the response on paper and asked his students to guess what he had written. After some moments of quiet reflection, a student surprised Frankl by saying, **“The meaning of your life is to help others find the meaning of theirs.”** “That was it, exactly,” Frankl said. “Those are the very words I had written.”
