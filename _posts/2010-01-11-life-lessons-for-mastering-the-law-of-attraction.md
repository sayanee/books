Thinking and Feeling...

> Look back over your life once gaain and notice the correlation between what you were thinking and feeling and what you were getting in life... Think about this. There is no exception to this law anywhere in the Universe. Absolutely None! It is a law of physics.

the how...

> By focusing on the _how_ at this stage, you stop the process that moves you towards realizing your dreams. ... In going to the _how_, you are trying to _control_ your future instead of _creating_ your future.

Intention and the results...

> You don't give up the intention, and you don't give up the desire. You give up your attachment to the result. ~ Deepak Chopra
You are always at choice...

> Do not settle for anything less than what you really want. You are declaring your worthiness. If you think something is not possible or is out of your reach, you're probably not going to commit much energy and resources to accomplishing that goal. When you decide a desire is possible and you areÂ  ready to have it, the Universe will assist you in having it unfold with ease.

forgiveness...

> I came to understand that if you cna't forgive someone, you cannot be open to abundance. If you are holding on to revenge, love can't walk in. If you are hanging on to resentment, you are hanging on to being a victim. And if you are holding on to being a victim, there's no space in your mind to be a victor.

Life, the teacher...

> "when the student is ready, the teacher appears". The teacher, however is not always a person. Sometimes the teacher appears simply as life, circumstances or synchronicities. I call them _road signs, _those apparently random events that show up in my life that bet to be notice.

money...

> Money never starts an idea; It's the idea that starts the money... ~ Mark Victor Hansen
