Consider flying 'open jaw'

> I routinely fly 'open jaw' into one city and out of another... ...

identity theft

- protect your credit card and debit card
- safeguard your PIN code
- use your credit card sparingly
- use your debit card even more sparingly
- make photocopies of your passport and credit cards
- be careful of what you email
- monitor your accounts

travellers' first aid kit

> band aids, antiseptic handi-wipes, antibiotic cream, moleskin, tweezers, thermometer in hard case, medication for colds + diarrhea

outsmarting thieves...

- money belts are peace of mind - a small nylon zipped pouch strapped around waist under your pants/skirts... you wear it completely hidden from sight
- operate with a day's spending money in your pocket - you don't need to get at your money belt for every euro

money belt items...

> passport, plane ticket, railpass, credit card, debit card, cash, plastic sheath to keep them dry, contact list, trip calendar + calendar
