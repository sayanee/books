## 12 for Healthy Sleep

1. Stick to a sleep schedule
1. Exercise is great, but not too late in the day.
1. Avoid caffeine and nicotine
1. Avoid alcoholic drinks before bed
1. Avoid large meals and beverages late at night
1. Avoid medicines that delay or disrupt your sleep
1. Don’t take naps after 3 p.m.
1. Relax before bed. Don’t over-schedule your day so that no time is left for unwinding.
1. Take a hot bath before bed
1. Dark bedroom, cool bedroom, smart phone-free bedroom.
1. Have the right sunlight exposure.
1. Don’t lie in bed awake.

## Side effects of not sleeping

Health problems

> Routinely sleeping less than six or seven hours a night **demolishes your immune system**, more than doubling your **risk of cancer**. Insufficient sleep is a key lifestyle factor determining whether or not you will **develop Alzheimer’s disease**.

Mental conditions

> Fitting Charlotte Brontë’s prophetic wisdom that “a ruffled mind makes a restless pillow,” sleep disruption further **contributes to all major psychiatric conditions, including depression, anxiety, and suicidality**.

Weight gain

> Too little sleep **swells concentrations of a hormone that makes you feel hungry** while suppressing a companion hormone that otherwise signals food satisfaction. Despite being full, you still want to eat more. It’s a **proven recipe for weight gain** in sleep-deficient adults and children alike.

Traffic accidents

> Tragically, one person dies in a traffic accident every hour in the United States due to a fatigue-related error. It is disquieting to learn that **vehicular accidents caused by drowsy driving exceed those caused by alcohol and drugs combined**.

## Characteristics of sleep

4 basic drives in life

> Consider that we have known the functions of the three other basic drives in life—**to eat, to drink, and to reproduce**—for many tens if not hundreds of years now. Yet the fourth main biological drive, common across the entire animal kingdom—the drive to sleep—has continued to elude science for millennia.

Dreaming

> Dreaming provides a unique suite of benefits to all species fortunate enough to experience it, humans included. Among these gifts are a **consoling neurochemical bath that mollifies painful memories** and a virtual reality space in which the brain **melds past and present knowledge, inspiring creativity**.

Reset body

> Emerging from this research renaissance is an unequivocal message: **sleep is the single most effective thing we can do to reset our brain and body health** each day—Mother Nature’s best effort yet at contra-death.

What makes you sleepy

> The first factor is a signal beamed out from your internal twenty-four-hour clock located deep within your brain. The **clock creates a cycling, day-night rhythm that makes you feel tired or alert at regular times** of night and day, respectively. The second factor is **a chemical substance that builds up in your brain and creates a “sleep pressure.”** The longer you’ve been awake, the more that chemical sleep pressure accumulates, and consequentially, the sleepier you feel.

Early afternoon is the most productive

> is no coincidence that the likelihood of breaking an Olympic record has been clearly tied to time of day, **being maximal at the natural peak of the human circadian rhythm** in the early afternoon.

Evidence of circadian rhythm even in plants

> Despite being cut off from the influence of light during the day, the plant still behaved as though it were being bathed in sunlight; its leaves were proudly expanded. Then, it **retracted its leaves as if on cue at the end of the day, even without the sun’s setting signal**, and they stayed collapsed throughout the entire night.

Evidence of circadian rhythm in humans: 24h 15m

> Years since Kleitman and Richardson’s seminal experiment, we have now determined that the average duration of a human adult’s endogenous circadian clock runs **around twenty-four hours and fifteen minutes in length**.

Sunlight is used for syncing the circadian rhythm

> It is no coincidence that the **brain uses daylight for this resetting purpose**. Daylight is the most reliable, repeating signal that we have in our environment.

Temperature changes throughout the day

> However, this temperature rhythm is not dependent upon whether you are actually asleep. If I were to keep you awake all night, your core body temperature would still show the same pattern. Although the **temperature drop helps to initiate sleep**, the temperature change itself will rise and fall across the twenty-four-hour period regardless of whether you are awake or asleep.

2 types of chronotypes in adults humans

> An adult’s **owlness or larkness**, also known as their chronotype, is strongly determined by genetics. If you are a night owl, it’s likely that one (or both) of your parents is a night owl. **Sadly, society treats night owls rather unfairly on two counts**.

Owls are penalised by the modern society

> Owls are thus often forced to burn the proverbial candle at both ends. Greater ill health caused by a lack of sleep therefore befalls owls, including higher rates of depression, anxiety, diabetes, cancer, heart attack, and stroke.

Work structures need to change

> In this regard, a societal change is needed, offering accommodations not dissimilar to those we make for other physically determined differences (e.g., sight impaired). We **require more supple work schedules that better adapt to all chronotypes**, and not just one in its extreme.

Melatonin

> Instructed by the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the **rise in melatonin begins soon after dusk, being released into the bloodstream** from the pineal gland, an area situated deep in the back of your brain.

Function of Melatonin

> Melatonin corrals these sleep-generating regions of the brain to the starting line of bedtime. **Melatonin simply provides the official instruction to commence the event of sleep**, but does not participate in the sleep race itself.

## What causes sleep disruption

Adjusting jetlags

> For every day you are in a different time zone, your suprachiasmatic nucleus can only **readjust by about one hour**.

Harder to travel eastward

> You may have noticed that it feels **harder to acclimate to a new time zone when traveling eastward than when flying westward**. There are two reasons for this. First, the eastward direction requires that you fall asleep earlier than you would normally, which is a tall biological order for the mind to simply will into action.

Consequence of changing time zones too many times

> Other studies of pilots, cabin crew members, and shift workers have reported additionally disquieting consequences, including **far higher rates of cancer and type 2 diabetes** than the general population—or even carefully controlled match individuals who do not travel as much.

Caffeine

> Caffeine has an average half-life of five to seven hours. Let’s say that you have a cup of coffee after your evening dinner, around 7:30 p.m. This means that by 1:30 a.m.,

Sleep trigger

> This powerful combination of abundant adenosine (high sleep pressure) and declining circadian rhythm (lowered activity levels) triggers a strong desire for sleep.

What happens during sleep

> During sleep, a mass evacuation gets under way as the brain has the chance to degrade and remove the day’s adenosine. Across the night, **sleep lifts the heavy weight of sleep pressure, lightening the adenosine load**. After approximately eight hours of healthy sleep in an adult, the **adenosine purge is complete**.

**Are you getting enough sleep?**

*Test A*

> First, after waking up in the morning, **could you fall back asleep at ten or eleven a.m.?** If the answer is “yes,” you are likely not getting sufficient sleep quantity and/or quality.

*Test B*

> Other questions that can draw out signs of insufficient sleep are: **If you didn’t set an alarm clock, would you sleep past that time?** (If so, you need more sleep than you are giving yourself.)

## What is sleep?

How do you know an organism is sleeping?

> First, sleeping organisms adopt a **stereotypical position**. In land animals, this is **often horizontal**, as was Jessica’s position on the couch. Second, and related, sleeping organisms have **lowered muscle tone**. This is most evident in the relaxation of postural (antigravity) skeletal muscles—those that keep you upright, preventing you from collapsing to the floor. Third, sleeping individuals show **no overt displays of communication or responsivity**. The fourth defining feature of sleep is that it’s **easily reversible**, differentiating it from coma, anesthesia, hibernation, and death.

2 phases of sleep

> As if that weren’t strange enough, Aserinsky also observed that these two phases of slumber (**sleep with eye movements, sleep with no eye movements**) would repeat in a somewhat regular pattern throughout the night, over, and over, and over again.

Names of these 2 phases

> At that moment Kleitman and Aserinsky realized the profound discovery they had made: humans don’t just sleep, but cycle through two completely different types of sleep. They named these sleep stages based on their defining ocular features: **non–rapid eye movement, or NREM, sleep, and rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep**.

Cycling between 2 types of sleep

> The cerebral war between the two is won and lost every ninety minutes, ruled first by NREM sleep, followed by the comeback of REM sleep. No sooner has the battle finished than it starts anew, replaying every ninety minutes. **Tracing this remarkable roller-coaster ebb and flow across the night reveals the quite beautiful cycling architecture of sleep**,

More NREM in the first phase, then more REM in the second phase

> In the first half of the night, the vast majority of our ninety-minute cycles are consumed by deep NREM sleep, and very little REM sleep, as can be seen in cycle 1 of the figure above. But as we transition through into the second half of the night, this seesaw balance shifts, with most of the time dominated by REM sleep, with little, if any, deep NREM sleep.

REM sleep happens on later on

> A danger resides in this sleep profile wherein NREM dominates early in the night, followed by an **REM sleep dominance later in the morning**, one of which most of the general public are unaware.

Sleeping less means, losing most of the REM sleep

> Since your brain desires most of its REM sleep in the last part of the night, which is to say the late-morning hours, **you will lose 60 to 90 percent of all your REM sleep, even though you are losing 25 percent of your total sleep time**.

NREM sleep function

> What you are actually experiencing during deep NREM sleep is one of the most epic displays of neural collaboration that we know of. Through **an astonishing act of self-organization**, many thousands of brain cells have all decided to unite and “sing,” or fire, in time. Every time I watch this **stunning act of neural synchrony occurring at night** in my own research laboratory, I am humbled: sleep is truly an object of awe.

File transfer process

> One benefit of these traveling deep-sleep brainwaves is a **file-transfer process**. Each night, the **long-range brainwaves of deep sleep will move memory packets (recent experiences) from a short-term storage site**, which is fragile, to a more permanent, and thus safer, long-term storage location.

REM Sleep has an awoken brain!

> Indeed, recent MRI scanning studies have found that there are individual parts of the brain that are up to **30 percent more active during REM sleep than when we are awake**!

Reception, reflection and integration

> When it comes to information processing, think of the wake state principally as **reception** (experiencing and constantly learning the world around you), NREM sleep as **reflection** (storing and strengthening those raw ingredients of new facts and skills), and REM sleep as **integration** (interconnecting these raw ingredients with each other, with all past experiences, and, in doing so, building an ever more accurate model of how the world works, including innovative insights and problem-solving abilities).

## Animal kingdom and human evolution

All animals sleep

> All have bona fide sleep. Ascend the evolutionary ladder further and we find that all types of birds and mammals sleep: from shrews to parrots, kangaroos, polar bears, bats, and, of course, we humans. **Sleep is universal.** Even invertebrates, such as primordial mollusks and echinoderms, and even very primitive worms, enjoy periods of slumber.

Life came after sleep

> What if sleep is so useful—so physiologically beneficial to every aspect of our being—that the real question is: **Why did life ever bother to wake up?** Considering how biologically damaging the state of wakefulness can often be, that is the true evolutionary puzzle here, not sleep. Adopt this perspective, and we can pose a very different theory: sleep was the first state of life on this planet, and **it was from sleep that wakefulness emerged**.

Different hours of sleep

> **Elephants** need half as much sleep as humans, requiring just four hours of slumber each day. **Tigers and lions** devour fifteen hours of daily sleep. The **brown bat** outperforms all other mammals, being awake for just five hours each day while sleeping nineteen hours. Total amount of time is one of the most conspicuous differences in how organisms sleep.

Only certain species have REM sleep

> Every species in which we can measure sleep stages experiences NREM sleep—the non-dreaming stage. However, insects, amphibians, fish, and most reptiles show no clear signs of REM sleep—the type associated with dreaming in humans. Only birds and mammals, which appeared **later in the evolutionary timeline of the animal kingdom**, have full-blown REM sleep.

In ocean, there is no REM sleep

> Partially aquatic mammals, they split their time between land and sea. When on land, they have both NREM sleep and REM sleep, just like humans and all other terrestrial mammals and birds. But when they enter the ocean, they stop having REM sleep almost entirely.

Some has REM sleep in the ocean

> believe a similar story of atypical, but nevertheless present, REM sleep will ultimately be observed in dolphins and whales and seals when in the ocean. After all, **absence of evidence is not evidence of absence**.

Sleep with / without deprivation

> There are two clear outcomes. First, and of little surprise, sleep duration is far longer on the **recovery night (ten or even twelve hours in humans)** than during a standard night without prior deprivation (eight hours for us).

Interesting ways of attaining deep sleep in birds for survival

> They will enter **deep sleep with just one half of the brain** (opposing in each), leaving the corresponding left and right eye of each bird wide open. In doing so, they provide full panoramic threat detection for the entire group, maximizing the total number of brain halves that can sleep within the flock.

Starvation makes us sleep less

> Starve a fly and it will stay awake longer, demonstrating a pattern of food-seeking behavior. The same is true for humans. **Individuals who are deliberately fasting will sleep less** as the brain is tricked into thinking that food has suddenly become scarce.

Deliberate sleep deprivation

> Yet the most **incredible feat of deliberate sleep deprivation** belongs to that of birds during transoceanic migration. During this climate-driven race across thousands of miles, entire flocks will fly for many more hours than is normal.

Biphasic sleep pattern

> Visit cultures that are untouched by electricity and you often see something rather different. Hunter-gatherer tribes, such as the Gabra in northern Kenya or the San people in the Kalahari Desert, whose way of life has changed little over the past thousands of years, **sleep in a biphasic pattern**. Both these groups take a similarly longer sleep period at night (seven to eight hours of time in bed, achieving about seven hours of sleep), followed by a **thirty- to sixty-minute nap in the afternoon**.

How did pre-modern people sleep?

> On average, these tribespeople will **fall asleep two to three hours after sunset**, around nine p.m. Their nighttime sleep bouts will come to an end just prior to, or **soon after, dawn**. Have you ever wondered about the **meaning of the term “midnight”**? It of course means the middle of the night, or, more technically, the middle point of the solar cycle.

Modern sleeping times

> Our circadian biology, and the insatiable early-morning demands of a post-industrial way of life, denies us the sleep we vitally need. At one time we **went to bed in the hours after dusk and woke up with the chickens**. Now many of us are **still waking up with the chickens, but dusk is simply the time we are finishing up at the office**, with much of the waking night to go.

Afternoon nap time

> All humans, irrespective of culture or geographical location, have a **genetically hardwired dip in alertness that occurs in the midafternoon hours**. Observe any post-lunch meeting around a boardroom table and this fact will become evidently clear.

Siestas

> It is perhaps unsurprising that in the small enclaves of Greece where **siestas still remain intact**, such as the island of Ikaria, men are nearly **four times as likely to reach the age of ninety as American males**.

Fire provided the answer to sleep

> How did Homo erectus (and by inference, Homo sapiens) **survive in the predator- rich ground-sleeping environment**, when leopards, hyenas, and saber-toothed tigers (all of which can hunt at night) are on the prowl, and terrestrial bloodsuckers abound? **Part of the answer is fire**.

Increase in REM sleep

> Any Homo erectus capable of accomplishing more efficient sleep would likely have been favored in survival and selection. Evolution saw to it that our **ancient form of sleep became somewhat shorter in duration, yet increased in intensity**, especially by enriching the amount of REM sleep we packed into the night.

REM sleep is the key to our human brains

> There are species that have more total REM time than hominids, but **there are none who power up and lavish such vast proportions of REM sleep onto such a complex, richly interconnected brain as we Homo sapiens do**.

What REM sleep gives to the homo sapiens

> posit that both have been beneficially and causally shaped by the hand of sleep, and specifically our intense degree of REM sleep relative to all other mammals: (1) our degree of **sociocultural complexity**, and (2) our **cognitive intelligence**. REM sleep, and the **act of dreaming itself, lubricates both of these human traits**.

EQ is dependent on REM sleep

> Related, the REM-sleep gift of facilitating accurate recognition and comprehension allows us to make more intelligent decisions and actions as a consequence. More specifically, the coolheaded ability to regulate our emotions each day—a key to what we call **emotional IQ—depends on getting sufficient REM sleep night after night**.

Gift of REM sleep

> From this REM-sleep-enhanced emotional IQ emerged a new and far more sophisticated form of hominid socioecology across vast collectives, one that helped enable the **creation of large, emotionally astute, stable, highly bonded, and intensely social communities** of humans.

REM-sleep vs NREM-sleep

> The second evolutionary contribution that the **REM-sleep dreaming state fuels is creativity. NREM sleep helps transfer and make safe newly learned information into long-term storage sites of the brain**. But it is REM sleep that takes these freshly minted memories and begins colliding them with the entire back catalog of your life’s autobiography.

Moving from tree to ground was key!

> **Our shift from tree to ground sleeping instigated an ever more bountiful amount of relative REM sleep** compared with other primates, and from this bounty emerged a steep increase in cognitive creativity, emotional intelligence, and thus social complexity.

## From fetus, newborns to adults and REM sleep

Adults vs baby during REM sleep

> Any co-occurring arm flicks and leg bops that the mother feels from her baby are most likely to be the consequence of random bursts of brain activity that typify REM sleep. Adults do not—or at least should not—throw out similar nighttime kicks and movements, since they are held back by the body-paralyzing mechanism of REM sleep.

Fetus development has huge NREM and REM sleep

> At this stage of in utero development, most of the time is spent in sleep. The twenty-four-hour period contains a mishmash of approximately **six hours of NREM sleep, six hours of REM sleep**, and twelve hours of an intermediary sleep state that we cannot confidently say is REM or NREM sleep, but **certainly is not full wakefulness**... In the last week before birth, **REM-sleep amount hits a lifetime high of twelve hours a day**.

REM sleep is vital in fetuses

> But we do know that REM sleep is vital for **promoting brain maturation**. The construction of a human being in the womb occurs in distinct, interdependent stages, a little bit like building a house... Without REM sleep, assembly work on the brain ground to a halt, frozen in time by the experimental wedge of a lack of REM sleep. Day after day, the half-finished roofline of the sleep-starved cerebral cortex shows no growth change.

Autism's understanding

> Our current understanding of what causes autism is incomplete, but central to the condition appears to be an **inappropriate wiring up of the brain during early developmental life**, specifically in the **formation and number of synapses** — that is, abnormal synaptogenesis.

Autism and sleep patterns

> Infants and young children who show signs of autism, or who are diagnosed with autism, **do not have normal sleep patterns or amounts**. The circadian rhythms of autistic children are also weaker than their non-autistic counterparts, showing a **flatter profile of melatonin** across the twenty-four-hour period rather than a powerful rise in concentration at night and rapid fall throughout the day.

Correlation is not causation in autism, but...

> Irrespective of causality issues, **tracking sleep abnormalities represents a new diagnostic hope** for the early detection of autism.

Alcohol and REM sleep during pregnancy

> The newborns of heavy-drinking mothers **spent far less time in the active state of REM sleep** compared with infants of similar age but who were born of mothers who did not drink during pregnancy.

Nursing with alcohol and REM sleep

> Beyond alcohol abstinence during pregnancy, the **time window of nursing** also warrants mention. Almost half of all lactating women in Western countries consume alcohol in the months during breastfeeding.

Newborns and REM sleep

> **Newborns will normally transition straight into REM sleep after a feeding**. Many mothers already know this: almost as soon as suckling stops, and sometimes even before, the infant’s eyelids will close, and underneath, the eyes will begin darting left-right, indicating that their baby is now being nourished by REM sleep.

Some things are still unknown...

> Sadly, we do not yet fully understand what the long-term effects are of fetal or neonate REM-sleep disruption, alcohol-triggered or otherwise. Only that blocking or reducing REM sleep in newborn animals hinders and distorts brain development, leading to an adult that is socially abnormal.

Rhythm will set in after 3/4 months

> Not until age **three or four months** will a newborn show modest signs of being governed by a **daily rhythm**.

4 years old should have a strong circadian system with biphasic sleep pattern

> By four years of age, the **circadian rhythm is in dominant command of a child’s sleep behavior**, with a lengthy slab of nighttime sleep, usually supplemented by just a single daytime nap. At this stage, the child has transitioned from a **polyphasic sleep pattern to a biphasic sleep pattern**.

Proportion of REM sleep decreases overtime

> other words, the **proportion of REM sleep decreases in early childhood while the proportion of NREM sleep actually increases**, even though total sleep time decreases.

Late teen sleep stabilization

> That balance will **finally stabilize to an 80/20 NREM/REM sleep split** by the late teen years, and remain so throughout early and mid adulthood.

Brain's analogy with Internet

> When first setting up the network, each home in the newly built neighborhood was **given an equal amount of connectivity bandwidth** and thus potential for use. However, that’s an inefficient solution for the long term, since **some of these homes will become heavy bandwidth users over time**, while other homes will consume very little.

Brain development is still young in teens

> His findings help justify an opinion you may also hold: **adolescents have a less rational version of an adult brain**, one that takes **more risks and has relatively poor decision-making skills**.

NREM vs REM

> The changes in deep NREM sleep always precede the **cognitive and developmental milestones** within the brain by several weeks or months, implying a direction of influence: **deep sleep may be a driving force of brain maturation**, not the other way around.

Sleep is required for safe driving age limit

> “Why do most 16-year-olds drive like they’re missing part of their brain? Because they are.” **It takes deep sleep, and developmental time, to accomplish the neural maturation** that plugs this brain “gap” within the frontal lobe. When your children finally reach their mid-twenties and your car insurance premium drops, you can thank sleep for the savings.

Psychiatric disorders and childhood

> Many of the major psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, and ADHD are now considered disorders of abnormal development, since they **commonly emerge during childhood and adolescence**.

Circadian system of children are earlier

> The reason is not simply that children need more sleep than their older siblings or parents, but also that the circadian rhythm of a young child runs on an earlier schedule. Children therefore **become sleepy earlier and wake up earlier than their adult parents**.

9 year old

> As a nine-year-old, the circadian rhythm would have the **child asleep by around nine p.m**., driven in part by the rising tide of melatonin at this time in children. By the time that same individual has reached sixteen years of age, their circadian rhythm has undergone a dramatic shift forward in its cycling phase.

Teenager's sleep pattern

> Sadly, neither society nor our parental attitudes are well designed to appreciate or accept that **teenagers need more sleep than adults**, and that they are **biologically wired to obtain that sleep at a different time from their parents**. It’s very understandable for parents to feel frustrated in this way, since they believe that their teenager’s sleep patterns reflect a conscious choice and not a biological edict.

Sleep is not laziness for adolescents

> We are still learning more about the role of sleep in development. However, **a strong case can already be made for defending sleep time in our adolescent youth, rather than denigrating sleep as a sign of laziness**. As parents, we are often too focused on what sleep is taking away from our teenagers, without stopping to think about what it may be adding.

Older adults

> That older adults simply need less sleep is a myth. Older adults appear to need just as much sleep as they do in midlife, but are simply less able to generate that (still necessary) sleep.

Explore non-sleeping pill methods

> Once again, I urge an elderly individual who may be concerned about their sleep not to seek a sleeping pill prescription. Instead, I recommend you first **explore the effective and scientifically proven non-pharmacological interventions**

Many health and mental problems

> Even when controlling for factors such as body mass index, gender, race, history of smoking, frequency of exercise, and medications, the lower an older individual’s sleep efficiency score, the higher their mortality risk, the worse their physical health, the more likely they are to **suffer from depression, the less energy they report, and the lower their cognitive function, typified by forgetfulness.**

Be careful immediately after waking up!

> We are often groggy when we wake up during the night. Add to this **cognitive haze the fact that it is dark**. Furthermore, having been recumbent in bed means that **when you stand and start moving, blood can race from your head**, encouraged by gravity, down toward your legs.

Older adults' circadian rhythm changes across years

> Changes in circadian rhythms with advancing age may appear harmless, but they can be the cause of numerous sleep (and wake) problems in the elderly. **Older adults often want to stay awake later into the evening** so that they can go to theater or the movies, socialize, read, or watch television.

Why it might not be insomnia!

> The **early-evening snooze will jettison precious sleep pressure**, clearing away the sleepiness power of adenosine that had been steadily building throughout the day. Several hours later, when that older individual gets into bed and tries to fall asleep, they may not have enough sleep pressure to fall asleep quickly, or stay asleep as easily. An **erroneous conclusion follows: “I have insomnia.”**

Challenges in the elderlies

> The change in circadian rhythm as we get older, together with more frequent trips to the bathroom, help to explain two of the three key nighttime issues in the elderly: early sleep onset/offset and sleep fragmentation.

Poor sleep is linked with many health problems

> More generally, these and similar studies have confirmed that **poor sleep is one of the most underappreciated factors** contributing to cognitive and medical ill health in the elderly, including issues of diabetes, depression, chronic pain, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and Alzheimer’s disease.

Mental or Physical health care provider

> We will come to learn that sleep is the **universal health care provider**: whatever the physical or mental ailment, sleep has a prescription it can dispense.

All stages of sleep are needed: NREM, deep-NREM and REM

> Numerous functions of the brain are restored by, and depend upon, sleep. No one type of sleep accomplishes all. **Each stage of sleep—light NREM sleep, deep NREM sleep, and REM sleep** — offer different brain benefits at different times of night. Thus, no one type of sleep is more essential than another. **Losing out on any one of these types of sleep will cause brain impairment.**

## Learning and Sleep

Sleep and learning

> **Sleep before learning refreshes our ability to initially make new memories**. It does so each and every night. While we are awake, the brain is constantly acquiring and absorbing novel information (intentionally or otherwise).

Sleep enhances learning and prevents saturation

> Our question was simple: Does the learning capacity of the human brain decline with continued time awake across the day and, if so, can **sleep reverse this saturation effect and thus restore learning ability**? Those who were awake throughout the day **became progressively worse at learning**, even though their ability to concentrate remained stable (determined by separate attention and response time tests). In contrast, those who napped did markedly better, and actually improved in their capacity to memorize facts.

Elderly brain and learning

> We conducted the study, and that is precisely what we found: the fewer the number of spindles an elderly brain produced on a particular night, the **lower the learning capacity of that older individual the next day**, making it more difficult for them to memorize the list of facts we presented.

Consolidation

> The second benefit of sleep for memory comes after learning, one that effectively clicks the “save” button on those newly created files. In doing so, **sleep protects newly acquired information**, affording immunity against forgetting: an operation called **consolidation**.

Sleep moves memories from short-term to long-term

> Before having slept, participants were fetching memories from the short-term storage site of the hippocampus—that temporary warehouse, which is a vulnerable place to live for any long duration of time if you are a new memory. But things looked very different by the next morning. The memories had moved. After the full night of sleep, participants were now retrieving that same information from the neocortex, which sits at the top of the brain

Information architecture of brain

> Sleep is **constantly modifying the information architecture of the brain at night**. Even daytime naps as short as twenty minutes can offer a memory consolidation advantage, so long as they contain enough NREM sleep.

Go through stuff you want to improve or solve the problem before sleeping

> What if a similar opportunity was possible with sleep and memory? **Before going to bed, you would review the learning experiences of the day, selecting only those memories from the menu list that you would like improved**. You place your order, then go to sleep, knowing that your order will be served to you overnight. When you wake up in the morning, your brain will have been nourished only by the specific items you ordered from the autobiographical carte du jour.

Targeted Memory
> It all sounds like the stuff of science fiction, but it is now science fact: the method is called **targeted memory reactivation**. And as is so often the case, the true story turns out to be far more fascinating than the fictional one.

Forgetting is sometimes good!

> Moreover, **forgetting is not just beneficial to delete stored information we no longer need**. It also lowers the brain resources required for retrieving those memories we want to retain, similar to the ease of finding important documents on a neatly organized, clutter-free desk.

Memories for both forgetting and remembering can be strengthened

> The results were clear. **Sleep powerfully, yet very selectively**, boosted the retention of those words previously tagged for “remembering,” yet actively avoided the strengthening of those memories tagged for “forgetting.”

What happens during NREM sleep

> The activity circles between the memory storage site (the hippocampus) and those regions that program the decision of intentionality (in the frontal lobe), such as “This is important” or “This is irrelevant.” The recursive cycle of activity between these two areas (**memory and intentionality**), which happens ten to fifteen times per second during the spindles, may help explain **NREM sleep’s discerning memory influence**.

Muscle memory is brain memory

> **Muscle memory is, in fact, brain memory**. Training and strengthening muscles can help you better execute a skilled memory routine. But the routine itself—the memory program—resides firmly and exclusively within the brain.

Recovery of brain damage patients

> What struck me about so many of these patients was an **iterative, step-by-step recovery of their motor function** after the stroke, be it legs, arms, fingers, or speech. Rarely was the recovery complete, but day by day, month by month, they all showed some improvement.

When a pianist practices and then sleeps

> Often, I **make the same mistake at the same place** in a particular movement. **I go to bed frustrated.** But when I wake up the next morning and sit back down at the piano, I can just play, perfectly.” “I can just play.” The words reverberated in my mind as I tried to compose a response.

Practice and then sleep!

> Practice does not make perfect. It is practice, **followed by a night of sleep**, that leads to perfection.

How skills become instinctual

> Rather than a transfer from short- to long-term memory required for saving facts, the **motor memories had been shifted over to brain circuits that operate below the level of consciousness**. As a result, those skill actions were now instinctual habits. They flowed out of the body with ease, **rather than feeling effortful and deliberate**.

Motor skills in infants

> It is of little surprise that we see a spike in stage 2 NREM sleep, including sleep spindles, right around the **infant’s time of transition from crawling to walking**.

Fusion of knowledge

> This task is accomplished using a bizarre algorithm that is biased toward seeking out the most distant, nonobvious associations, rather like a backward Google search. In ways your waking brain would never attempt, the **sleeping brain fuses together disparate sets of knowledge that foster impressive problem-solving abilities**.

Study 1

> Those individuals who slept eight hours every night maintained a stable, near-perfect performance across the two weeks. Those in the three-night total sleep deprivation group suffered catastrophic impairment, which was no real surprise. After the first night of no sleep at all, their **lapses in concentration (missed responses) increased by over 400 percent**.

Study 2

> But it was the two partial sleep deprivation groups that brought the most concerning message of all. After four hours of sleep for six nights, participants’ performance was just as bad as those who had not slept for twenty-four hours straight—that is, a 400 percent increase in the number of microsleeps. By day 11 on this diet of four hours of sleep a night, participants’ performance had degraded even further

6 hours a night is common in society

> Most worrying from a societal perspective were the individuals in the group who obtained six hours of sleep a night—something that may sound familiar to many of you. **Ten days of six hours of sleep a night was all it took to become as impaired in performance** as going without sleep for twenty-four hours straight.

You are NOT a good judge of your performance

> When participants were asked about their subjective sense of how impaired they were, they consistently **underestimated their degree of performance disability**. It was a miserable predictor of how bad their performance actually, objectively was. It is the equivalent of someone

An individual will acclimate

> Similarly problematic is baseline resetting. With chronic sleep restriction over months or years, **an individual will actually acclimate to their impaired performance, lower alertness, and reduced energy levels**. That low-level exhaustion becomes their accepted norm, or baseline.

4/5 hours of sleep is not enough!

> **Sixty years of scientific research prevent me from accepting** anyone who tells me that he or she can “get by on just four or five hours of sleep a night just fine.”

You can "recover" sleep

> Nor did any group recover all the sleep hours they had lost in the days prior. As we have already learned, the brain is incapable of that.

Sleep-deprived or legaly drunk!

> After being awake for nineteen hours, people who were sleep-deprived were as cognitively impaired as those who were legally drunk. Said another way, if you wake up at seven a.m. and remain awake throughout the day, then go out socializing with friends until late that evening, yet drink no alcohol whatsoever, by the time you are driving home at two a.m. you are as cognitively impaired in your ability to attend to the road and what is around you as a legally drunk driver.

go to sleep after 16 hours!

> The recycle rate of a human being is around sixteen hours. **After sixteen hours of being awake, the brain begins to fail.** Humans need more than seven hours of sleep each night to maintain cognitive performance.

Don't drive when sleep deprived!

> This is one of the most important: if you are drowsy while driving, please, please stop. It is lethal. To carry the burden of another’s death on your shoulders is a terrible thing.

Power naps do not replace 8 hours of good night sleep!

> Brief power naps have become synonymous with the inaccurate assumption that they allow an individual to forgo sufficient sleep, night after night, especially when combined with the liberal use of caffeine.

Sleep deprivation with cognitive decline is inevitable

> David Dinges has extended an open invitation to anyone suggesting that they can survive on short sleep to come to his lab for a ten-day stay. He will place that individual on their proclaimed regiment of short sleep and **measure their cognitive function**. Dinges is rightly confident he’ll show, categorically, a degradation of brain and body function.

Emotional problems

> Insufficient sleep has also been **linked to aggression, bullying, and behavioral problems** in children across a range of ages. A similar relationship between a lack of sleep and violence has been observed in adult prison populations; places that, I should add, are woefully poor at enabling good sleep that could reduce aggression,

Addictions

> **Hypersensitivity to pleasurable experiences can lead to sensation-seeking, risk-taking, and addiction**. Sleep disturbance is a recognized hallmark associated with addictive substance use.

Sleep and many psychological disorders

> **There is no major psychiatric condition in which sleep is normal.** This is true of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder (once known as manic depression).

Cause and effect are not certain yet, but...

> However, a prevailing view in psychiatry has been that **mental disorders cause sleep disruption**—a one-way street of influence. Instead, we have demonstrated that otherwise healthy people can experience a neurological pattern of brain activity similar to that observed in many of these psychiatric conditions simply by having their sleep disrupted or blocked.

Research is yet to find the cause and effect

> Had psychiatry got the causal direction wrong, and it was sleep disruption instigating mental illness, not the other way around? No, I believe that is equally inaccurate and reductionist to suggest.

Improving sleep helps psychiatric patients

> By improving **sleep quantity, quality, and regularity**, Harvey and her team have systematically demonstrated the healing abilities of sleep for the minds of numerous psychiatric populations.

Is cramming for exams effective?

> Those few **memories you are able to learn while sleep-deprived are forgotten far more quickly** in the hours and days thereafter. Memories formed without sleep are weaker memories, evaporating rapidly.

Stoic institutions to implement proper sleep schedules

> As many have said about such stoic institutions: **theories, beliefs, and practices die one generation at a time**. But the conversation and battle must start somewhere.

How educational institutes can change...

> There are no “final” exams at the end of the semester in my classes. Instead, I split my courses up into thirds so that students only have to study a handful of lectures at a time. Furthermore, **none of the exams are cumulative**. It’s a tried-and-true effect in the psychology of memory, described as mass versus spaced learning... it is far more preferable to separate the educational meal into smaller courses, with breaks in between to allow for digestion, rather than attempt to cram all of those informational calories down in one go.

Sleep is not like a bank

> In terms of memory, then, sleep is not like the bank. You cannot accumulate a debt and hope to pay it off at a later point in time. Sleep for memory consolidation is an all-or-nothing event. It is a concerning result in our 24/7, hurry-up, don’t-wait society.

Sleep deprivation and diseases from developed world

> The two most feared diseases throughout developed nations are **dementia and cancer**. Both are related to inadequate sleep.

Alzheimer’s disease

> More telling, perhaps, is the fact that **sleep disturbance precedes the onset of Alzheimer’s disease by several years**, suggesting that it may be an early-warning sign of the condition, or even a contributor to it.

Cleansing during sleep

> Glial cells are distributed throughout your entire brain, situated side by side with the neurons that generate the electrical impulses of your brain. Just as the lymphatic system drains contaminants from your body, the **glymphatic system collects and removes dangerous metabolic contaminants generated by the hard work performed by neurons in your brain**, rather like a support team surrounding an elite athlete.

Examples...

> Parenthetically, and unscientifically, I have always found it curious that Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan—two heads of state that were very vocal, if not proud, about sleeping only four to five hours a night—both went on to develop the ruthless disease.

A possible longitudinal study

> If we can find a method that is cost effective and can be scaled up to the population level for repeat use, my goal is prevention. Can we begin supplementing the declining deep sleep of vulnerable members of society during midlife, many decades before the tipping point of Alzheimer’s disease is reached, **aiming to avert dementia risk later in life**?

Heart failure and sleep

> I should note that in many of these studies, the **relationship between short sleep and heart failure** remains strong even after controlling for other known cardiac risk factors, such as smoking, physical activity, and body mass. A lack of sleep more than accomplishes its own, independent attack on the heart.

Sleeping in midlife

> Adults **forty-five years or older who sleep fewer than six hours a night are 200 percent more likely to have a heart attack or stroke** during their lifetime, as compared with those sleeping seven to eight hours a night. This finding impresses how important it is to **prioritize sleep in midlife**—which is unfortunately the time when family and professional circumstances encourage us to do the exact opposite.

How sleep deprivation makes the heart work harder

> One night of modest sleep reduction—even just one or two hours—will promptly speed the contracting rate of a person’s heart, hour upon hour, and **significantly increase the systolic blood pressure within their vasculature**.

Growth hormone

> Making matters worse, **growth hormone—a great healer of the body—which normally surges at night**, is shut off by the state of sleep deprivation. Without growth hormone to replenish the lining of your blood vessels, called the endothelium, they will be slowly shorn and stripped of their integrity.

An example of sleep deprivation

> In the Northern Hemisphere, the switch to daylight savings time in March results in most people losing an hour of sleep opportunity. Should you tabulate millions of daily hospital records, as researchers have done, you discover that this seemingly trivial sleep reduction comes with a **frightening spike in heart attacks the following day**.

Being overweight and hormones

> When your sleep becomes short, you will gain weight. Multiple forces conspire to expand your waistline. The first concerns two hormones controlling appetite: leptin and ghrelin. Leptin signals a sense of feeling full. When circulating levels of leptin are high, your appetite is blunted and you don’t feel like eating. Ghrelin, in contrast, triggers a strong sensation of hunger.

Study for hunger while being sleep deprived

> Using precisely this experimental design in a group of healthy, lean participants, Van Cauter discovered that individuals were far more ravenous when sleeping four to five hours a night. This despite being given the same amount of food and being similarly active, which kept the hunger levels of these same individuals under calm control when they were getting eight or more hours of sleep.

How sleep deprivation causes false food hunger

> It was a classic case of physiological double jeopardy: participants were being punished twice for the same offense of short sleeping: once by having the **“I’m full” signal removed from their system**, and once by **gaining the “I’m still hungry” feeling being amplified**. As a result, participants just didn’t feel satisfied by food when they were short sleeping.

Sleep is intensely metabolically active state

> Sleep, it turns out, is an **intensely metabolically active state for brain and body alike**. For this reason, theories proposing that we sleep to conserve large amounts of energy are no longer entertained.

Sleep and gut bacteria

> Sleep’s role in redressing the balance of the body’s nervous system, especially its **calming of the fight-or-flight sympathetic branch**, improves the bacterial community known as your microbiome, which is located in your gut

Dieting with sleep deprivation does not work

> When you are not getting enough sleep, the **body becomes especially stingy about giving up fat**. Instead, muscle mass is depleted while fat is retained. Lean and toned is unlikely to be the outcome of dieting when you are cutting sleep short.

Sleep deprivation and infection

> There was a clear, linear relationship with infection rate. The **less sleep an individual was getting in the week before facing the active common cold virus**, the more likely it was that they would be infected and catch a cold.

Shift work and its perils

> A number of prominent epidemiological studies have reported that nighttime shift work, and the **disruption to circadian rhythms and sleep that it causes**, up your odds of developing numerous different forms of cancer considerably.

Poor sleep and cancer development

> Poor sleep quality therefore increases the risk of cancer development and, if cancer is established, provides a virulent fertilizer for its rapid and more rampant growth.

## Dreams

Dreams are essential

> Yet for reasons that are only now becoming clear, the brain state called REM sleep and the mental experience that goes along with it, dreaming, are **normal biological and psychological processes**, and truly essential ones, as we shall learn.

Dreaming is an active state

> However, something very different happens as the individual transitions into REM sleep and begins to dream. **Numerous parts of the brain “light up” on the MRI scan as REM sleep takes hold**, indicating a sharp increase in underlying activity.

Dreaming and emotions

> in REM sleep: (1) the visuospatial regions at the back of the brain, which enable complex visual perception; (2) the motor cortex, which instigates movement; (3) the hippocampus and surrounding regions that we have spoken about before, which support your **autobiographical memory**; and (4) the deep **emotional centers** of the brain—the amygdala and the cingulate cortex, a ribbon of tissue that sits above the amygdala and lines the inner surface of your brain—both of which help generate and process emotions. Indeed, these **emotional regions of the brain are up to 30 percent more active in REM sleep** compared to when we are awake!

Freud made the connection of dreams to our brains

> Freud had single-handedly wrested dreams from the ownership of celestial beings, and from the anatomically unclear location of the soul. In doing so, Freud made dreams a clear domain of what would become neuroscience—that is, the terra firma of the brain.

Daytime emotions and concerns are related to dreams

> But Stickgold did find a strong and predictive daytime signal in the static of nighttime dream reports: emotions. Between 35 and 55 percent of **emotional themes and concerns that participants were having while they were awake during the day** powerfully and unambiguously resurfaced in the dreams they were having at night.

How dreams help

> REM-sleep dreaming offers a form of **overnight therapy**. That is, REM-sleep dreaming **takes the painful sting out of difficult, even traumatic, emotional episodes** you have experienced during the day, offering **emotional resolution when you awake the next morning**.

Dreams helps in soothing out our emotions

> Is the REM-sleep dreaming state a **perfectly designed nocturnal soothing balm** — one that **removes the emotional sharp edges of our daily lives**? It seemed so from everything neurobiology and neurophysiology was telling us (me).

Benefits of REM sleep

> It postulated that the process of REM-sleep dreaming accomplishes two critical goals: (1) sleeping to **remember the details of those valuable, salient experiences**, integrating them with existing knowledge and putting them into autobiographical perspective, yet (2) sleeping to **forget, or dissolve, the visceral, painful emotional charge** that had previously been wrapped around those memories.

Not forgotten, but not affected either

> Also notice, however, that **your recall of these detailed memories is no longer accompanied by the same degree of emotion** that was present at the time of the experience. You have not forgotten the memory, but you have **cast off the emotional charge**, or at least a significant amount of

Post Traumatic Syndrome Disorder patients were given a medicine that prevented nightmares

> In his PTSD clinic, Raskind had been treating his war veteran patients with a generic drug called prazosin to manage their high blood pressure. While the drug was somewhat effective for lowering blood pressure in the body, Raskind found it had a far more powerful yet entirely unexpected benefit within the brain: it alleviated the reoccurring nightmares in his PTSD patients.

Prazosin

> Prazosin was gradually lowering the harmful high tide of noradrenaline within the brain, giving these patients healthier REM-sleep quality. With healthy REM sleep came a reduction in the patients’ clinical symptoms and, most critically, a decrease in the frequency of their repetitive nightmares.

Sleep deprived and emotions

> as if the brain was in a state of generalized hypersensitivity **without the ability to map gradations of emotional signals from the outside world**. Gone was the precise ability to read giveaway clues in another’s face. The brain’s emotional navigation system had lost its true magnetic north of directionality and sensitivity: a compass that otherwise guides us toward numerous evolutionary advantages.

Jobs demanding accurate ability to read emotions

> Now think of occupations that require individuals to be sleep-deprived, such as **law enforcement and military personnel, doctors, nurses**, and those in the emergency services—not to mention the **ultimate caretaking job: new parents**. Every one of these roles demands the accurate ability to read the emotions of others in order to make critical, even life-dependent, decisions...

REM sleep calibrates before adolescence

> Looking across the life span, we have discovered that this **REM-sleep recalibration service comes into its own just prior to the transition into adolescence**. Before that, when children are still under close watch from their parents, and many salient assessments and decisions are made by Mom and/or Dad, REM sleep provides less of a re-tuning benefit to a child’s brain.

Dreaming and problem-solving example

> In Mendeleev’s own words:II I saw in a dream a table where all the elements fell into place as required. Awakening, I immediately wrote it down on a piece of paper. Only in one place did a correction later seem necessary.

Anecdotal evidence vs. statistical evidence

> Anecdotes such as these are enjoyable stories to tell, **but they do not serve as experimental data**. What, then, is the scientific evidence establishing that sleep, and specifically REM sleep and dreaming, provides a form of associative memory processing—one that fosters problem solving?

Solutions after sleep

> The solutions simply “popped out” following awakenings from REM sleep, one subject told me, though at the time, they did not know they had been in REM sleep just prior. Solutions seemed more effortless when the brain was being bathed by the afterglow of dream sleep.

REM sleep helps connect distantly related concepts

> The REM-sleep dreaming brain was utterly uninterested in bland, commonsense links—the one-step-to-the-next associations. Instead, the REM-sleep brain was **shortcutting the obvious links and favoring very distantly related concepts**.

Who can afford the links?

> Only those who had slept and **obtained late-morning REM sleep, rich in dreaming**, showed evidence of linking the memory elements together (A>B>C>D>E>F, etc.), making them capable of the most distant associative leaps (e.g., B>E). The very same benefit was found after daytime naps of sixty to ninety minutes that also included REM sleep.

Difference between storing memory (computer) and linking them (humans)

> Some may consider this informational daisy-chaining to be trivial, but it is one of the key operations differentiating your brain from your computer. Computers can store thousands of individual files with precision. But **standard computers do not intelligently interlink those files in numerous and creative combinations**. Instead, computer files sit like isolated islands. Our human memories are, on the other hand, **richly interconnected in webs of associations that lead to flexible, predictive powers**.

REM sleep plays a critical role in language development

> As you will recall, REM sleep is especially dominant during this early-life window, and it is that **REM sleep that plays a critical role in the development of language, we believe**.

Edison and napping

> We will never truly know if Edison was the short-sleeper that some, including himself, claim. What we do know, however, is that Edison was a **habitual daytime napper**. He understood the creative brilliance of dreaming, and used it ruthlessly as a tool, describing it as “the genius gap.”

Lucid dreaming

> Lucid dreaming occurs at the moment when an individual becomes aware that he or she is dreaming. However, the term is more colloquially used to describe **gaining volitional control of what an individual is dreaming, and the ability to manipulate that experience**, such as deciding to fly, or perhaps even the functions of it, such as problem solving.

2 challenges in Insomnia

> One distinction separates insomnia into two kinds. The first is **sleep onset insomnia**, which is difficulty falling asleep. The second is **sleep maintenance insomnia, or difficulty staying asleep**. As the actor and comedian Billy Crystal has said when describing his own battles with insomnia, “I sleep like a baby—I wake up every hour.”

Insomnia is more long term

> All of us will experience difficulty sleeping every now and then, which may last just one night or several. That is normal. There is usually an obvious cause, such as work stress or a flare-up in a social or romantic relationship. Once these things subside, though, the sleep difficulty usually goes away.

Common causes of Insomnia

> The two most common triggers of chronic insomnia are **psychological**: (1) emotional concerns, or worry, and (2) emotional distress, or anxiety.

Emotional programming during Insomnia

> Recursive loops of emotional programs, together with **retrospective and prospective memory loops**, keep playing in the mind, preventing the brain from shutting down and switching into sleep mode.

Insomnia affects 24 hours

> All of which means that insomnia patients wake up not feeling refreshed. Consequentially, patients are unable to function well during the day, cognitively and/or emotionally. In this way, **insomnia is really a 24/7 disorder**: as much a disorder of the day as of the night.

Absence of REM sleep and NREM sleep is death

> rats lost their lives almost as quickly from selective REM-sleep deprivation as they did following total sleep deprivation. A total absence of NREM sleep still proved fatal, it just took longer to inflict the same mortal consequence—forty-five days, on average.

Sleep time vs sleep opp

> The problem is that **some people confuse time slept with sleep opportunity time**. We know that many individuals in the modern world only give themselves 5 to 6.5 hours of sleep opportunity, which normally means they will only obtain around 4.5 to 6 hours of actual sleep.

Why hunter-gatherer tribes are not obese

> One of the few universal ways of forcing animals of all kinds to sleep less than normal amounts is to limit food, applying a degree of starvation. **When food becomes scarce, sleep becomes scarce**, as animals try to stay awake longer to forage. Part of the reason that these hunter-gatherer tribes are not obese is because they are constantly searching for food, which is never abundant for long stretches.

Sleeping less than 7 hours is a myth!

> Concluding that humans, modern-living or pre-industrial, **need less than seven hours of sleep** therefore appears to be a wishful conceit, and a tabloid myth.

Sleeping more than 9 hours is also bad

> Rather, there is an **upward hook in death risk once the average sleep amount passes nine hours**, resulting in a tilted backward J shape

Sleeping longer when sick

> Ergo, the **sickest individuals should be sleeping longer** to battle back against illness using the suite of health tools sleep has on offer. It is simply that some illnesses, such as cancer, can be too powerful even for the mighty force of sleep to overcome, no matter how much sleep is obtained.

Too much food, water, sleep are all bad!

> Keep in mind that **food, oxygen, and water** are no different, and they, too, have **a reverse-J-shape relationship with mortality risk**. Eating to excess shortens life. Extreme hydration can lead to fatal increases in blood pressure associated with stroke or heart attack. Too much oxygen in the blood, known as hyperoxia, is toxic to cells, especially those of the brain.

16 + 8

> There is an adaptive balance to be struck between wakefulness and sleep. In humans, that appears to be **around sixteen hours of total wakefulness, and around eight hours of total sleep**, for an average adult.

How modern sleep has been changed

> five key factors have powerfully changed how much and how well we sleep: (1) constant electric light as well as LED light, (2) regularized temperature, (3) caffeine (discussed in chapter 2), (4) alcohol, and (5) a legacy of punching time cards.

Modern life with electricity

> For the first time, the human race had a truly scalable method of unbuckling itself from our planet’s natural twenty-four-hour cycle of light and dark. With a proverbial flick of a switch came a whimsical ability to control our environmental light and, with it, our wake and sleep phases.

Even gas and oil-burning lamps were better

> Gas- and oil-burning lamps, and their forerunners, candles, **offered a more forceful influence upon sustained nighttime activities**. Gaze at a Renoir painting of nineteenth-century Parisian life and you will see the extended reach of artificial light.

Artificial light during evenings

> Artificial evening light, even that of modest strength, or lux, will **fool your suprachiasmatic nucleus into believing the sun has not yet set**. The brake on melatonin, which should otherwise have been released with the timing of dusk, remains forcefully applied within your brain under duress of electric light.

Even a small bedside lamp is not good

> What of a petite bedside lamp? How much can that really influence your suprachiasmatic nucleus? A lot, it turns out. **Even a hint of dim light—8 to 10 lux—has been shown to delay the release of nighttime melatonin** in humans.

Blue light indicates day

> The light receptors in the eye that communicate “daytime” to the suprachiasmatic nucleus are most sensitive to short-wavelength light within the blue spectrum—the exact sweet spot where **blue LEDs are most powerful**.

Use of electronics device before sleeping

> A recent survey of over fifteen hundred American adults found that 90 percent of individuals **regularly used some form of portable electronic device sixty minutes or less before bedtime**. It has a very real impact on your melatonin release, and thus ability to time the onset of sleep.

Reading a printed paper is better than electronic device

> The two-week period was split in half, containing two different experimental arms that everyone passed through: (1) five nights of reading a book on an iPad for several hours before bed (no other iPad uses, such as email or Internet, were allowed), and (2) five nights of **reading a printed paper book for several hours before bed**, with the two conditions randomized in terms of which the participants experienced as first or second. Compared to reading a printed book, **reading on an iPad suppressed melatonin release by over 50 percent at night**.

Powerful blue light after evening

> The devices are a wonderful piece of technology. They enrich the lives and education of our youth. But such technology is also enriching their eyes and brains with powerful blue light that has a damaging effect on sleep—the sleep that young, developing brains so desperately need in order to flourish.

How to counter evening lights?

> **Mood lighting is the order of the night**. Some committed individuals will even wear yellow-tinted glasses indoors in the afternoon and evening to help **filter out the most harmful blue light that suppresses melatonin**.

Steps to counter blue light in the evening

> **Maintaining complete darkness throughout the night is equally critical**, the easiest fix for which comes from blackout curtains. Finally, you can install software on your computers, phones, and tablet devices that **gradually de-saturate the harmful blue LED light as evening progresses**.

## Alcohol and sedation

Alcohol sedates the brain

> **Alcohol immobilizes that part of our brain first**. As a result, we “loosen up,” becoming less controlled and more extroverted. But anatomically targeted brain sedation it still is.

Sleep and sedation are not the same

> This is your brain slipping into sedation. Your **desire and ability to remain conscious are decreasing**, and you can let go of consciousness more easily. I am very deliberately avoiding the term “sleep,” however, because sedation is not sleep.

Aldehydes and REM sleep generation

> When the body metabolizes alcohol it produces by-product chemicals called **aldehydes and ketones**. The aldehydes in particular will block the brain’s **ability to generate REM sleep**. It’s rather like the cerebral version of cardiac arrest, preventing the pulsating beat of brainwaves that otherwise power dream sleep.

Alcohol also makes you forget

> In contrast, those who had their sleep laced with alcohol on the first night after learning suffered what can conservatively be described as partial amnesia seven days later, **forgetting more than 50 percent of all that original knowledge**. This fits well with evidence we discussed earlier: that of the brain’s non-negotiable requirement for sleep the first night after learning for the purposes of memory processing.

No no to nightly alcohol

> Many people enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, even an aperitif thereafter. But it takes your liver and kidneys many hours to degrade and excrete that alcohol, even if you are an individual with fast-acting enzymes for ethanol decomposition. **Nightly alcohol will disrupt your sleep**, and the annoying advice of abstinence is the best, and most honest, I can offer.

Set the bedroom temperature  to 18.3°C

> A bedroom temperature of around 65 degrees Fahrenheit **(18.3°C) is ideal for the sleep of most people**, assuming standard bedding and clothing. This surprises many, as it sounds just a little too cold for comfort. Of course, that specific temperature will vary depending on the individual in question and their unique physiology, gender, and age. But like calorie recommendations, it’s a good target for the average human being.

Warming helps to reduce the body temperature

> Scientists have, for example, **gently warmed the feet or the body** of rats to encourage blood to rise to the surface of the skin and emit heat, thereby decreasing core body temperature. The rats drifted off to sleep far faster than was otherwise normal.

Why alarm clock is bad

> Compare the physiological state of the body after being **rudely awakened by an alarm to that observed after naturally waking from sleep**. Participants artificially wrenched from sleep will **suffer a spike in blood pressure and a shock acceleration in heart rate** caused by an explosive burst of activity from the fight-or-flight branch of the nervous system.

Stay with the schedule

> Waking up at the same time of day, every day, no matter if it is the week or weekend is a good recommendation for **maintaining a stable sleep schedule** if you are having difficulty with sleep.

## Sleeping pills and its perils

Natural sleep is not the same as taking prescription sleeping pills

> No past or current sleeping medications on the legal (or illegal) market induce natural sleep. Don’t get me wrong—no one would claim that you are awake after taking prescription sleeping pills. But to suggest that you are experiencing natural sleep would be an equally false assertion.

Dependency on sleeping pills

> We should not be surprised by this. The majority of prescription sleeping pills are, after all, in **a class of physically addictive drugs**. Dependency scales with continued use, and withdrawal ensues in abstinence.

Sleeping pills are dangerous!

> He wanted to explore whether there was a relationship between sleeping pill use and altered disease or mortality risk. There was. Time and again, the same message emerged from the analyses: **individuals taking sleeping pills were significantly more likely to die** across the study periods

Medicated sleep is not the same as natural sleep

> Why, then, do individuals who are taking sleeping pills that purportedly “improve” sleep suffer higher rates of various infections, when the opposite is predicted? It is possible that **medication-induced sleep does not provide the same restorative immune benefits as natural sleep**.

## Curing insomnia through CBT

Using Cognitive Behavioral theory treatment instead of medicines

> Currently, the most effective of these is called cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, or CBT-I, and it is rapidly being embraced by the medical community as the first-line treatment.

Some simple steps to help in sleeping

> The obvious methods involve **reducing caffeine and alcohol intake**, removing screen technology from the bedroom, and having a cool bedroom. In addition, patients must (1) establish a **regular bedtime and wake-up time, even on weekends**, (2) go to bed only when sleepy and **avoid sleeping on the couch early/mid-evenings**, (3) never lie awake in bed for a significant time period; rather, get out of bed and do something quiet and relaxing until the urge to sleep returns, (4) **avoid daytime napping** if you are having difficulty sleeping at night, (5) reduce anxiety-provoking thoughts and worries by learning to mentally decelerate before bed, and (6) **remove visible clockfaces from view in the bedroom**, preventing clock-watching anxiety at night.

Without sleep, exercise exertion is also less

> When sleep was poor the night prior, **exercise intensity and duration were far worse the following day**. When sleep was sound, levels of physical exertion were powerfully maximal the next day. In other words, **sleep may have more of an influence on exercise than exercise has on sleep**.

Exercise and sleep go hand in hand

> Participants also **feel more alert and energetic** as a result of the sleep improvement, and signs of depression proportionally decrease. It is clear that a sedentary life is one that does not help with sound sleep, and all of us should try to **engage in some degree of regular exercise** to help maintain not only the fitness of our bodies but also the quantity and quality of our sleep.

Don't exercise right before sleeping

> One brief note of caution regarding physical activity: **try not to exercise right before bed**. Body temperature can remain high for an hour or two after physical exertion. Should this occur too close to bedtime, it can be **difficult to drop your core temperature sufficiently** to initiate sleep due to the exercise-driven increase in metabolic rate.

Avoid carbohydrates or sleeping too full or hungry

> Nevertheless, for healthy sleep, the scientific evidence suggests that you should **avoid going to bed too full or too hungry**, and shy away from diets that are excessively **biased toward carbohydrates** (greater than 70 percent of all energy intake), especially sugar.

## Work culture

Sleep is not like a bank!

> Each weekend, vast numbers of people are desperately trying to pay back a sleep debt they’ve accrued during the week. As we have learned time and again throughout the course of this book, sleep is not like a credit system or the bank. The brain can never recover all the sleep it has been deprived of.

Glorifying sleep deprivation

> **We glorify the high-powered executive** on email until 1:00 a.m., and then in the office by 5:45 a.m.; we laud the airport “warrior” who has traveled through five different time zones on seven flights over the past eight days.

Punctuality is not productivity

> This mentality has persisted, in part, because **certain business leaders mistakenly believe that time on-task equates with task completion and productivity**. Even in the industrial era of rote factory work, this was untrue. It is a misguided fallacy, and an expensive one, too.

What truly matters in the end?

> Numerous employee traits determine these measures, but commonly they include: **creativity, intelligence, motivation, effort, efficiency, effectiveness when working in groups, as well as emotional stability, sociability, and honesty**. All of these are systematically dismantled by insufficient sleep.

Insufficient makes people choose less challenging problems

> Give participants the ability to choose between work tasks of varying effort, from easy (e.g., listening to voice mails) to difficult (e.g., helping design a complex project that requires thoughtful problem solving and creative planning), and you find that those individuals who obtained less sleep in the preceding days are the same people who **consistently select less challenging problems**.

Maybe insufficient sleep is causing tasks to take long?

> People often tell me that they do not have enough time to sleep because they have so much work to do. Without wanting to be combative in any way whatsoever, I respond by informing them that perhaps **the reason they still have so much to do at the end of the day is precisely because they do not get enough sleep at night**.

Risk of having under-slept employees

> Under-slept employees are not only **less productive, less motivated, less creative, less happy, and lazier, but they are also more unethical**. Reputation in business can be a make-or-break factor. Having under-slept employees in your business makes you more vulnerable to that risk of disrepute.

Effective and stable leadership day in and out

> Differences in individual leadership performance fluctuate dramatically from one day to the next, and the size of that difference far exceeds the average difference from one individual leader to another. So what explains the **ups and downs of a leader’s ability to effectively lead**, day to day? The amount of sleep they are getting is one clear factor.

Benefits of arriving at work well rested

> Allowing and encouraging employees, supervisors, and executives to arrive at work well rested **turns them from simply looking busy yet ineffective, to being productive, honest, useful individuals** who inspire, support, and help each other.

Nap corners in offices

> Littered throughout their corporate headquarters are **dedicated relaxation rooms with “nap pods.”** Employees can indulge in sleep throughout the workday in these “shh” zones, germinating productivity and creativity while **enhancing wellness and reducing absenteeism**.

Adjusting working hours

> Everyone would be present during a **core window for key interactions—say, twelve to three p.m.** Yet there would be **flexible tail ends** either side to accommodate all individual chronotypes. Owls could start work late (e.g., noon) and continue into the evening, giving their full force of mental capacity and physical energy to their jobs.


## School culture

Circadian rhythm of teenagers

> Previously, we noted that the **circadian rhythm of teenagers shifts forward dramatically by one to three hours**. So really the question I should ask you, if you are an adult, is this: Could you concentrate and learn anything after having forcefully been woken up at 3:15 a.m., day after day after day?

Early school start times are vulnerable

> **Forced by the hand of early school start times**, this state of chronic sleep deprivation is especially concerning considering that adolescence is the most susceptible phase of life for developing chronic mental illnesses, such as **depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and suicidality.**

REM sleep and mental diagnoses

> Only then did scientists realize the rather profound conclusions of the experiment: **REM sleep is what stands between rationality and insanity**. Describe these symptoms to a psychiatrist without informing them of the REM-sleep deprivation context, and the clinician will give clear diagnoses of **depression, anxiety disorders, and schizophrenia.**

REM sleep happens in the final hours of sleep

> It is the lack of **REM sleep—that critical stage occurring in the final hours of sleep** that we strip from our children and teenagers by way of early school start times—that creates the difference between a stable and unstable mental state.

Schools used to have later start times

> century ago, **schools in the US started at nine a.m.** As a result, 95 percent of all children woke up without an alarm clock. Now, the inverse is true, caused by the incessant marching back of school start times—**which are in direct conflict with children’s evolutionarily preprogrammed need to be asleep** during these precious, REM-sleep-rich morning hours.

Lower socioeconomic students are in greater danger

> Children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds are less likely to be taken to school in a car, in part because their parents often have jobs in the service industry demanding work start times at or before six a.m. Such children therefore rely on school buses for transit, and must wake up earlier than those taken to school by their parents.

Later finishing time also protects the kids

> In addition, later start times beneficially mean a later finish time. This **protects many teens from the well-researched “danger window” between three and six p.m.,** when schools finish but before parents return home. This unsupervised, vulnerable time period is a recognized cause of **involvement in crime and alcohol and substance abuse.**

ADHD and sleep deprivation

> I am in no way contesting the disorder of ADHD, and not every child with ADHD has poor sleep. But we know that there are children, many children, perhaps, who are sleep-deprived or suffering from an undiagnosed sleep disorder that masquerades as ADHD.

## Doctors

The legend of Halsted

> Fledgling residents had to suffer long, consecutive work shifts, day and night. To Halsted, sleep was a dispensable luxury that detracted from the ability to work and learn. Halsted’s mentality was difficult to argue with, since he himself practiced what he preached, being renowned for a **seemingly superhuman ability to stay awake for apparently days on end without any fatigue.**

No amount of experience can solve sleep deprivation

> No amount of years on the job helps a doctor “learn” **how to overcome a lack of sleep and develop resilience**. How could it? Mother Nature spent millions of years implementing this essential physiological need. To think that bravado, willpower, or a few decades of experience can absolve you (a surgeon) of **an evolutionarily ancient necessity is the type of hubris** that, as we know from the evidence, costs lives.

## Technological help

Using technology to help with sleep

> Within three to five years, I am quite certain there will be **commercially available, affordable devices that track an individual’s sleep and circadian rhythm with high accuracy**. When that happens, we can marry these individual sleep trackers with the revolution of in-home networked devices like **thermostats and lighting**.

Natural rise and fall in temperature

> Better still, we could program a **natural circadian lull and rise in temperature** across the night that is in harmony with each body’s expectations, rather than the constant nighttime temperature set in most homes and apartments.

LED lights with yellow or blue light depending the time of the day

> Soon, we should be able to engineer **LED bulbs with filters that can vary the wavelength of light that they emit, ranging from warm yellow colors less harmful to melatonin**, to strong blue light that powerfully suppresses it.

Catering to a sudden change in an early morning meeting

> For example, if you have an **unusually early morning meeting in the middle of the workweek, this technology, synched to your online calendar, would gradually begin shifting you** (your circadian rhythm) to a slightly earlier bed and rise time starting on Monday.

Early morning blue light exposure

> The bulbs were to be installed in the space station to bathe the astronauts in a much more Earth-like cycle of twenty-four-hour light and dark. With regulated environmental light came a superior regulation of the astronauts’ biological melatonin rhythms, including their sleep, thereby reducing operations errors associated with fatigue.



> Harnessing smartphones as a central hub to gather an individual’s health data from various sources—physical activity (such as number of steps or minutes and intensity of exercise), **light exposure, temperature, heart rate, body weight, food intake, work productivity**, or mood—we show each individual how their own sleep is a direct predictor of their own physical and mental health.
