**Some extracts**:

10 ways to think like a billionaire...

1. **Don't take vacations**. What's the point? If you're not enjoying your work, you're in the wrong job.
2. **Have short attention span**. Most successful people have very short attention spans. It has a lot to do with imagination.
3. **Don't sleep anymore than you have to**. I usually sleep about 4 hours per night. I'm in bed by 1am and get up to read newspapers at 5am
4. **Don't depend on technology**. A lot of it is unnecessary and expensive. I don't have a computer on my desk. I don't use an intercom. When i want someone in my office, i yell :P
5. **Think of yourself as a one-man army**. You're not only the commander in chief. Your're the soldier as well. You must plan and execute your plan alone.
6. **It's often to your advantage to be underestimated**. You never want people to think you're a loser or a schlep, but it's no the good idea if they think you're the smartest guy in the room.
7. **Success breeds success**. The best way to impress people is through results. It's easier for me to do deals now because i have had so many triumphs... ... ... If you're young and you haven't had any success yet, then you have to create the impression of success.
8. **Friends are good, but family is better**. It's better to trust your family than your friends.
9. **Treat each decision like a lover**. ... Sometimes people are surprised by how quickly i make big decisions, but i've learned to trust my instincts and not to over-think things.
10. **Be curious**. A successful person is always going to be curious. I don't know why this is true, but it's definitely the case. You have to be alive to your surroundings and hungry to understand your immediate world. Otherwise, you'll lack the perspective to see beyond yourself.

I thought of writing out the chapter headings of **Part III - The Business Life**, to give you a glimpse as to what this book covers... really interesting slices of a billionaire's life! And trust me each of these chapters were not more than 2 pages long...
