bear facts... i found this really hilarious :P

> The best advice when dealing with grizzly bears is to try to avoid them, and if you happen to see one, stay calm and avoid threatening them. Sometimes a bear will start charging, then veer off or stop abruptly. Bear experts recommend that you stand still until the bear stops, and then slowly back away. If you are attacked, play dead: Drop to the ground, lift your legs up to the chest and clasp your hands over the back of your neck. For black bears, you should raise your arms, join hands with a companion to appear really big, and talk to the bear in a low deep voice. "Go away, Mr Bear", usually works!!!
