Netting a bug list...

> When you are off your own beaten path, however, you are more open to discovery: when you travel, especially overseas, when you rent an unfamiliar car; when you try a new sport or experience a new activity. At those times you are more open to ask the childlike "Why?" and "Why not?" questions that lead to innovation. Whenever you are in that new-to-the-experience mode, I urge you to pay close attention and even take notes about your impressions, creations and questions. Especially the problems, the things that bug you. We call these mental and jotted-down observations "bug lists" and they can change your life.

Keeping close to the action....

> Why so many high-tech companies have emerged form Silicon Valley - and not connecticut or even New York. New ideas come from seeing, smelling, hearing - being there. ... Asking questions of people who were there, who should know, often isn't enough. It doesn't matter how smart they are, how well they know the product or the opportunities. It doesn't matter how many astute questions they ask If you are not in the jungle, you're not going to know the tiger.

gap...

> Successful innovations recognize that people don't always do the "right" thing or make the necessary leaps to bridge the gap between familiar and genuinely new ideas. Widespread adoption often takes time. Astute observation is one way to shorten that cycle and make trade-offs that users will accept.

Abundance of ideas....

> There's something terribly liberating about applying an abundance mentality to your ideas, thinking and work. There's a Zen-like force here at play: The less you strive to control ideas and insist on credit for those that are yours, the more good ideas you're likely to have 0 and see implemented. it's why we believe in brainstorming. Good things happen when you willingly take your best ideas and pour them into the mix.
