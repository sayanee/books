How to Win Friends and Influence People & How to stop worrying and start living by [Dale Carnegie ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_Carnegie)- these 2 best sellers were combined in this book. If i can sum up in just 2 words about what this book exactly teaches, it'll be tactfulness and diplomacy. It's a great book... in fact i would wanna buy it!

On criticism... (pg 29)

> When dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with creatures of logic. We are dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity. ... ... Benjamin Franklin, tactless in his youth, became so diplomatic, so adroit at handling people, that he made American Ambassador to France. The secret of his success? "I will speak ill of no man," he said, "... and speak all the good I know of everybody."

> Any fool can criticise, condemn and complain - most fools do. But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving.

A practical book with practical straight forward advice. Think i’ll make a summary of some of the principles stated in this book...
