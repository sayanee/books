- **Author**: Seth Godin
- **Year written/published**: 2007
- **Some extracts**:

> The time to look for a new job is when you don't need one. The time to switch jobs is before it feels comfortable. Go. Switch. Challenge yourself, get yourself a raise and a promotion. You owe it to your career and your skills.

3 questions to ask before quitting:

1. Am I panicking?
2. Who am I influencing?
3. What sort of measurable progress am I making?

> So, there's tool number one. If quitting is going to be a strategic decision that enables you to make smart choices in the marketplace, then you should outline your quitting strategy before the discomfort sets in.
