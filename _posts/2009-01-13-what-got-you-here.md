They are transactional flaws performed by one person against other. They are:

1. Wining too much
2. Adding too much value – the overwhelming desire to add our 2 cents to every discussion
3. passing judgement
4. Making destructive comments
5. Starting with ‘no’, ‘but’ or ‘however’
6. telling the world how smart we are
7. speaking when angry – using emotional volatility as a management tool
8. negativity
9. withholding information – refusal to share information in order to maintain an advantage over others
10. failing to give proper recognition
11. claiming credit that we don’t deserve
12. making excuses
13. clinging to the past
14. playing favourites
15. refusing to express regret – the inability to take responsibility for our actions, admit we’re wrong
16. not listening
17. failing to express gratitude
18. punishing the messenger – the misguided need to attack the innocent who are usually only trying to help us
19. passing the buck – the need to blame everyone but ourselves
20. an excessive need to be ‘me’
