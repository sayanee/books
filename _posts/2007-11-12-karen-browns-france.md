Some extracts:

Normandy

> Follow the Seine north out of Paris on the A13 and exit at Bonnieres sur Siene. Travel a scenic route following the N15 north along the Seine to Vernon. As you cross the Seine with the village of Vernonette sitting at the crossroads, you see the remains of the picturesque 12rh century bridge and an ancient timbered dungeon. Just a few kilometers upstream lies the village of **Giverny**, a name synonymous worldwide with artist Claude Monet who came to live in the village in 1883.

Roeun

> Rich in history, **Roeun** is termed the museum city, but it is also famous for its magnificent cathedral and its connection with Joan of Arc and the Dauphon.

Bayeux

> **Bayeux** was the first French town to be liberated and it seems appropriate to begin our D-Day journey here. On the mian ring road around the old town is the 1944 Battle of Normandy Museum.

Mont Saint Michel

> Straddling the border of Brittany and Normandy, **Mont Saint Michel** is France’s most visited tourist attraction. Joined to the mainland by a marrow strip of roadway, Mont Saint Michel, initially a place of pilgrimage, then a fortress and in the 19th century a prison, clings to rock island and towers 150 meters above the sea level.

French Alps

> From geneva, travel a gorgeous narrow valley shadowed by the towering peaks in the direction of **Chamonix** and **Mont Blanc**. If you're in a rush you could take the autoroute but the N205 parallels the autorouts and seems just as efficient and perhaps nprettier as it travels through the villages. This area is absolutely gorgeous in spring and summer, with a dramatic backdrop of high-covered peals that contrast with lush green pastures dotted with chalets, grazing cattle and as abundance of wildflowers.

Chateaux Country includes... too many beautiful breathtaking castles!
