Evenmindedness

> “Why be elated by material profit?” Father replied. “The one who pursues a goal of evenmindedness is neither jubilant with gain nor depressed by loss. He knows that man arrives penniless in this world, and departs without a single rupee.”

Absolute

> “God is simple. Everything else is complex. Do not seek absolute values in the relative world of nature.”

Burying your ideals

> Thoughtless is the man who buries his ideals, surrendering to the common fate.

Miracles

> Performances of miracles such as shown by the “Perfume Saint” are spectacular but spiritually useless. Having little purpose beyond entertainment, they are digressions from a serious search for God.

Changes

> Awake in God, true saints effect changes in this dream-world by means of a will harmoniously attuned to the Creative Cosmic Dreamer.

Mind

> All creative scientists know that the **true laboratory is the mind**, where behind illusions they uncover the laws of truth.
