8 steps are:

1. Start investing – NOW
2. Establish a goal – it doesn’t matter what it is as long as it matters to you
3. Buy only stocks and stock mutual funds. Forget about asset allocation
4. Swing for singles. You’ll strike out fewer times and hot some runs in the process
5. Invest every month no matter how small the investment
6. Buy and hold… and hold… and hold.. and hold
7. Take what uncle Sam gives you – tax efficient policies… take them!
8. Limit shocks to you finances – e.g. for shocks are divorce, too many children, changing jobs

Some mistakes…

2. Selling too soon
3. Selling too late
4. Blindly following the advice of friends, coworkers, and especially brokers
5. Market timing
6. ‘micro’ timing stock purchases
7. speculating in future, options and speculative stocks
8. reacting to news
9. ignoring the ‘little thing’ of investing – tax + brokerage fees

- Buy funds whose turnover is less than 100% and preferably less than 50%
- avoid fast growing funds that invest in small company stocks
- focus on funds that have at least 3 year track record with the same fund manager
