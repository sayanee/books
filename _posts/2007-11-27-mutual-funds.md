How many funds??

> Still, after 4 funds, the effect of adding another fund on standard deviation declined. After 7 funds, changes were slight, and after 10 funds the portfolio’s standard deviation stayed the same no matter how many more funds were added. Therefore, after owning 7 to 10 funds, it may be unnecessary to add more to a portfolio.
