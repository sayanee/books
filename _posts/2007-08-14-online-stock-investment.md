Portfolio Management...

> A portfolio is a collection of stocks, bonds, and other assets owned by an investor at a particular point in time. Portfolio Management is about which assets )eg. stock, bonds) to invest, how much to invest in each asset, and monitoring the investment to maximise return and minimise risks. The concept of portfolio management is originated form the  work of Markowitz, who was the first to quantify risks and demonstrate quantitatively why and how portfolio diversification reduced risks and optimise return for investors. Markowitz also introduced the concept of an efficient portfolio, which has the smallest attainable portfolio risk for a given level of expected return or the largest expected return for a given level of risk.
