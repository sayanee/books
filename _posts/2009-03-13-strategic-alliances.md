Competitive collaboration adhere to a set of simple but powerful principles:

- Collaboration is competition in a different form
- Harmony is not the most important measure of success
- Cooperation has limits. Companies must defend against competitive compromise
- Leaning from partners is paramount

Avoiding self-deception:

- We’re better off partnering with X than competing against it in our core business
- By joining forces with another second tier company, we can create a strong company while fixing our problems together
- We need a strong partner to improve skills
- by partnering with another company in our industry, we can access its new products and technologies while minimizing our investments in core products and technologies
- We can use an alliance to raise capital without giving up management control

6 types of alliances:

1. Collision between competitors
2. alliances of the weak
3. disguised sales
4. bootstrap alliances
5. evolutions to a sale
6. alliances of complementary equals

some lessons learnt:

- Groups are only as strong as the alliances within them: manage individual relationships carefully
- Effective groups are worth more than the sum of the alliances within them: manage the group as a whole
- the sky is not the limit in alliance groups: expand with caution where you sit in which network determines what you get: position your company strategically within and among alliance groups
- a lack of commitment is the flip side of flexibility: be sure that the network strategy is sustainable for your company
