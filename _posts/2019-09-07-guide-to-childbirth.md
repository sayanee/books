## Birth stories

Change with birth

> That night in our room I realized what an amazing gift our new baby was, but I also felt sadness and a sense of loss within myself. I knew this was the **beginning of his new life and the end of my selfishness** and the part of me that was holding on to still being a child myself. My life was no longer my own. This was still the **happiest and most spiritual day of my life**.

Birth of the baby and then the placenta

> I tried to pull him up to my breast, but Dawn stopped me because the **umbilical cord wasn’t long enough** for him to reach that far. My **placenta came quickly after the cord stopped pulsing**, and Aaron cut it. I pulled the baby to my breast and **he began nursing** like he’d already done it before.

Cervix dilation and contractions

> I went two weeks over my due date. I knew I was growing another big baby, but I didn’t want to go on Pitocin again. I finally went into labor, with **contractions never much closer together than five to six minutes apart**. I was making progress, however, and felt things were going well. I was **five centimeters dilated when I got to the hospital**.

Cervix dilation is not linear!

> progressed from three and a half centimeters to nine and a half centimeters in about five hours. The hardest part of **my labor was getting “hung up” at nine and a half centimeters for over three hours**.

Birthdays are linked with childbirth anniversaries too!

> The intrusive thoughts that my body had failed to do what a woman’s body is designed to do—to give birth—**caused me to relive “the day I nearly died” with every birthday my daughter celebrated for years after**. I learned not to give details of my story, for fear of scaring those yet to become parents, but I know now that telling the story would have helped.

Active labor

> Active labor was like being on a different planet. My consciousness changed; **I became unaware of the control** I’m used to having as a civilized adult human and I just let my body do its thing.

So many has experienced childbirth!

> I started to feel a bit scared. I had dreaded transition, and here it was. I started thinking about all animals in labor at that exact second on the planet. Humans, elephants, whales, mice, all having their babies. I felt less alone. **The only way out is through.**

Childbirths at home are approved medically safe

> I need to mention that the low medical intervention rates that my team and I achieved in the first years of practice had a lot to do with the **good health of the pregnant women** for whom we cared. We had every incentive to care only for women who did not already have a medical condition that would rule out a planned home birth. Hospitals don’t have the freedom to limit the care they provide only to those women who are already healthy or actively improving their health—the stance that was our obligation.

Medically ok women are suitable for vaginal birth

> Contrary to myth, for instance, **intrinsic physical characteristics only rarely interfere** with the capacity to give birth. In other words, your pelvis is probably big enough for a vaginal birth

Mind over body

> **Mental attitudes, levels of stress, and emotions**, on the other hand, may interfere with the ability to give birth far more than is generally understood, because they have a **powerful effect on the hormones released in your body that help or hinder the birth process**.

Mental, physical and medical preparation

> We saw that **women could sleep or eat or drink during labor**, that it was important to choose words that wouldn’t scare them, and that it was often **important for them to move around freely during labor**. The combination of these simple practices produces a gestalt that **leads to relaxed, happy, enthusiastic mothers and healthy babies most of the time**. At the same time, we value (as we always have) the **hospitals and obstetricians who are necessary when unanticipated complications present** themselves.

Oxytocin

> Love and gratitude are inextricably intertwined. When they flow together, the **oxytocin levels in the birthplace may rise and offer incredible possibilities for transformative moments**.

Atmosphere around the mother

> That mother’s demeanor, throughout her quick, intense labor (often the most painful), was **calm and assured** — as long as everyone in her presence maintained the same sense of **gratitude, courage, and surrender** to something higher than all of us, which she was holding.

Relaxing the pelvic muscles

> I learned that true words spoken can sometimes **relax pelvic muscles** by discharging emotions that effectively block further progress in labor.

Childbirth requires maximum relaxation

> If any bodily process ever required a **maximum degree of relaxation**, it is birth. Babies are the biggest things that pass through any of our orifices. Ever.

Labours might slow down or stop

> presence of even one person who is not exquisitely attuned to the mother’s feelings can stop some women’s labors. All women are sensitive. Some women are extraordinarily so. We learned this truth by observing **many labors stop or slow down when someone entered the birth room who was not intimate with the laboring mother’s feelings**.

Possible for cervix to close

> I noticed that it is **possible for a woman’s cervix to “go into reverse” after dilating more than halfway**.

Doctors vs midwives who sees through the entire labour of a woman

> They also said that doctors in these cases rarely, if ever, believe that the cervix truly was more open before. For them, it is easier to believe that the nurse or nurse-midwife was wrong. There is a reason for this. Only **rarely do doctors in training have the opportunity to sit continuously with laboring women for hours**.

Female bodies are designed strongly for childbirth

> This widespread belief in the badly designed female body has become so strong in many women’s minds that they give in to pharmaceutical or surgical treatments when **patience and recognition of the normality and harmlessness** of the situation would make for better health for them and their babies and **less surgery and technological intervention in birth. Most women need encouragement and companionship** more than they need drugs.

Get upright and move around

> if your labor is accelerated by intravenous oxytocin, you are likely to experience a significantly greater level of pain than you otherwise would have had. **Being upright and moving around** may help alleviate this.

Female bodies have the same potential as animals to give birth

> Human female bodies have the same potential to give birth well as aardvarks, lions, rhinoceroses, elephants, moose, and water buffalo. Even if it has not been your habit throughout your life so far, I recommend that you learn to think positively about your body.

Amniotic fluid sac and placenta

> The membranous, nearly transparent bag of salty fluid—a miniature ocean—contains the baby and its umbilical cord. The cord leads to the placenta, a short-lived but wondrous organ that, maintaining its attachment to the baby at the navel, is planted in the rich uterine lining of blood vessels and serves a multitude of purposes in pregnancy. The placenta does the work that will later be taken up by the baby’s lungs, digestive system, liver, excretory organs, and the two chambers of the baby’s heart that mostly don’t function during intrauterine life.

2nd stage of labour

> Once the cervix is pulled completely open, a combination of uterine contractions and some pressure from the abdominal muscles pushes the baby outside of the mother’s body. This is called the second stage of labor. It lasts until the birth of the baby. **Gravity can greatly affect progress during this part of labor.**

Breaks in between labour

> One of the best features of labor is the rest periods that occur between these contractions. Hardly anyone seems to talk about these in birth preparation books, but they are one of the most brilliant features of labor. Savor every second of them. Appreciate them. They are your **chance to relax and enjoy feeling “normal” and alive**.

3rd stage of labour

> The third stage of labor lasts from the birth of the baby until the expulsion of the placenta. The uterus continues to contract after the birth of the baby, quickly diminishing its size to that of the placenta. Further contractions **shear the placenta from the uterine lining**.

4th stage of labour

> The fourth stage of labor is the postpartum or newborn period, **roughly the six weeks that follow childbirth**. This is the time during which the mother’s body adjusts to new motherhood and returns to the nonpregnant state.

Slowing down or stopping labour is possible

> Fear is a normal and natural emotion that evolved for our protection from danger. Evolutionarily speaking, both abilities—**moving forward in labor or stopping it—were necessary to the survival of the species**. Laboring females in the wild needed to **halt the process of birth in case of danger** and to have a sudden boost in physical energy for escape if they sensed a predator nearby.

Adrenaline and excitement / danger

> Adrenaline increases the blood pressure and shunts blood away from the uterus and baby and toward the heart, lungs, and major muscle groups in order to make extraordinary powers of strength and speed possible during the fight-or-flight response. Once the danger is past, this ancient alarm system switches off, and we return to normal.

Stress hormones released when...

> Stress hormones may also be released in women who have no particular fear of birth or their bodies, as **a response to lack of privacy, lights that are too bright, fear of exceeding a time limit in labor, or routine procedures that are uncomfortable or humiliating**.

Conditions for labour: calm and privacy

> Kerstin Uvnäs Moberg, a Swedish physician and professor of physiology, and her team of researchers have produced and gathered together an enormous body of research that validates the ancient knowledge of birth-giving the world over: that women tend to labor best when their **need for privacy is respected and when a trusted and calm person is nearby**.

How to stimulate natural oxytocin release

> Deep, slow breathing; meditation; singing; dancing; laughing; pleasurable touch; kissing; praise; hugging; and prayer all **stimulate natural oxytocin release**. All of these actions have the power to reduce fear with no unpleasant or risky side effects.

Mindfulness

> Here is a simple exercise to do in pregnancy. Sit quietly in a comfortable position. Close your eyes and pay attention to your thoughts and feelings. Your thoughts may be positive and enjoyable or some may be difficult or unpleasant. Let them pass without judging them. Don’t identify with them, but do notice them. Notice your breathing: how you breathe in and how you exhale.

Dealing with pain

> In some countries, including the United States, probably a majority of women consider it a hardship to labor without some form of anesthesia. There are exceptions, of course, including the women of The Farm and Old Order Amish communities, among others. In other countries of similar wealth (the Netherlands and Japan are prime examples), most women do not expect to be given anesthesia for a normal physiological process such as labor and birth. **If there is pain, it is not something to focus on. It is part of nature and therefore not to be feared.**

Expectation of pain will raise the need for narcotics and nerve block

> Two-thirds of the U.S. group were given narcotics during labor, along with some type of nerve block for birth. The U.S. women expected labor to be more painful than the Dutch women did, and they expected to be given medication for pain. In both groups, **the proportions of women expecting pain to those who actually received medication were nearly identical**.

What's the difference during labour in hospital?

> The hospital group rated childbirth pain significantly higher than did the home-birth group. There are some good reasons why birth pain seems to be less for women who have home births. First, they are far less likely than women having hospital births to be **confined to lying in bed during labor, to be denied food and drink, or to have strangers around them as they labor**. The normal creature comforts of everyday life—moving around freely, eating and drinking at will—are just as compelling during labor, if not more so than they usually are.

2 kinds of pain: fight it (wounded) or let go (childbirth)

> “Run away!” or “Fight! You are being damaged.” This is survival information. The pain of labor and birth has an entirely different message. It says: “**Relax your pelvic muscles. Let go. Surrender. Go with the flow. Don’t fight this.** It’s bigger than you.”

Range of painful labour experiences

> Realize that I’m not promising you an orgasm or a painless labor, no matter how brave or fearless you may be. No one can make such promises. What I’m doing here is **expanding awareness of the great range of possibilities in birth experiences**, and how circumstances and attitudes affect experiences.

Baby's position during birth

> Another factor is that babies sometimes get into positions that are more likely to be painful, such as the **baby whose body is facing mother’s belly** (the occiput posterior, or OP, position), rather than the baby facing mother’s side or back. The same goes for the baby who is holding one or both hands next to or above his head, or the one whose head is tipped and therefore entering mother’s pelvis at an angle

Drama and television childbirth

> Most women in North America and many other countries now gain their first ideas of birth from television or film portrayals of birth in hospital dramas or sitcoms. **Drama feeds on the sensational and the danger-charged moment.**

Labour pain does not cause any damage to the body unlike a wound

> When you are finished experiencing normal labor pain, it is over. You cannot reexperience its sensation by remembering it. Labor pain is a special type of pain: It **almost always happens without causing any damage to the body**.

## Birth interventions

Cons to take note for birth interventions

> Epidurals cause **long-term backache** in approximately one woman in every five. Sometimes the use of forceps and vacuum extractors results in **injury to the baby or the mother**. Intravenous lines are **painful for as long as they are in place** and for a couple of days after they are removed. The more you move and disturb that plastic in your vein, the more it hurts.

Hep-lock vs IV

> The same is true if a hep-lock is inserted in the back of your hand early in labor, just in case you might need an IV later on. You do have the right to refuse this. That said, a **hep-lock is easier to deal with than an IV line**.

A safe birth without any interventions

> The woman who gives birth without interventions, on the other hand, is more apt to be through with pain when her baby is born. Often, she is euphoric, buoyed on the hormones released after the birth of the baby. **Oxytocin, the love hormone, is released with the final stretch** of the perineum around the baby’s head and body, a pleasant sensation for most women.

## Modern thinking about birth

3 Ps: Passenger, Passage, Power

> most U.S. women and virtually all obstetricians believe in a set of assumptions that obstetricians call the “Law of the Three Ps.” The Three Ps are the **Passenger (the baby), the Passage (the pelvis and vagina), and the Powers (the strength of uterine contractions)**.

The problem with the 3Ps

> The problem with the Law of the Three Ps is that it ignores the considerable evidence demonstrating the **importance of emotional, psychological, and spiritual aspects of birth**. This leaves many physicians thinking that a large percentage of U.S. women are born with some deficiency that prevents them from giving birth without enormous technological intervention, when in fact almost all would be able to give birth given the right care and circumstances.

Modern women vs traditional women

> Intellectually curious physicians have long wondered why **women from traditional cultures generally have an easier time giving birth** than women whose connection with the natural world is more tenuous.

## Sphincter Law

THE BASICS OF SPHINCTER LAW: Excretory, cervical, and vaginal

- They function best in an atmosphere of intimacy and privacy
- They cannot be opened at will and do not respond well to commands
- They may suddenly close down if that person becomes upset, frightened, humiliated, or self-conscious
- The state of **relaxation of the mouth and jaw** is directly correlated to the ability of the cervix, the vagina, and the anus to open to full capacity
- Laughter Helps Open the Sphincters
- Slow, Deep Breathing Aids the Opening of Sphincters
- Deep abdominal breathing causes a general relaxation of the muscles of the body, especially muscles of the pelvic floor
- Immersion in a warm-water bath can also be very calming to a laboring mother

Similarity with potty training

> infants, these sphincters have not yet fully developed their ability to remain contracted until it is socially acceptable for them to relax. Learning to maintain this measure of sphincter control is the goal of potty training, which usually takes place during the second or third year of life for infants in the industrialized world.

When sphincter muscles are most relaxed

> Sphincters, like the involuntary muscles, are affected by the emotions. They **function most comfortably and smoothly in an atmosphere that is relaxed and free from discordant emotions**. Probably because our organs of elimination are in close proximity to or, in the case of men, double as organs of reproduction, public toilets are usually segregated on the basis of gender.

Opening of the womb and vagina are also like sphincters!

> Understanding the true process of labor and birth becomes easier when we learn that the opening of the womb (the cervix) and the vagina are also sphincters. In many ways **they function like other sphincters of the human body**. They perform normal bodily functions.

Pushing will take place naturally

> It is a fairly common practice in hospitals in most of the industrialized world for laboring women to be strenuously commanded to push once they reach full dilation. Such commands are often given without the awareness that, in most cases, the urge to push will arise spontaneously in the mother. **Pushing will take place without the mother requiring someone to shout at her when and how to do it.**

Why the sphincters might suddenly close

> The sudden contraction of previously relaxed sphincter muscles is a **fear-based reaction**. This is part of the natural fight-or-flight response to perceived danger. Adrenaline/catecholamines rise in the bloodstream when the organism is frightened or angered.

Birth story of how it ended in a cesarean

> Her labor never reestablished itself after the obstetrician’s rude internal examination, so this mother’s baby was born by cesarean. To the woman’s neocortex, this man may have been an obstetrician. To her cervix and her primitive brain, he was a predator.

What helps: changing positions, walking, eating, being upright

> Nowadays, of course, it is possible to restart or to intensify labor with synthetic oxytocic drugs delivered intravenously. This may be convenient when truly necessary, but **intravenous drugs used to keep women in labor also prevent them from moving around freely and cause more painful contractions**. **Changing positions, walking, being nourished, and being upright during labor** are hugely important to women’s ability to give birth under their own power.

How humour helps

> Pain-numbing endorphins, nature’s opiates, are instantly effective and have no negative side effects. A smile is good. A chuckle is better. A good belly laugh is one of the most effective forms of anesthesia.

Deep abdominal breathing

> This deep abdominal breathing is not only **relaxing to the heart, the nervous system, and the mind, it also allows for the greatest lung expansion**. This increases the amount of oxygen that can fill your lungs. It can help you relax enough to go to sleep.

As above, so below

> Understanding the connection between top and bottom can ease pain and discomfort of constipation, premenstrual tension, period cramps, labor and birth, and afterpains. If you feel like grinding your teeth or clenching your jaw, catch yourself!

Open mouths

> Early in my career, I observed many women laboring with open mouths and throats, relaxed, making the sounds associated with pleasurable lovemaking.

Blowing raspberries

> This is called “horse lips” or “blowing raspberries.” When a person totally relaxes the lips and blows a good amount of air through them at considerable pressure, softly flapping them together in the process, it is reminiscent of the soft, lip-flapping sound that horses make. I find that when women in labor attempt to make this sound (even if they don’t quite succeed), it significantly **relaxes their mouth, throat, and, at the same time, their bottom (cervix and perineum)**.

## Midwifery

Midwifery

> midwifery model of care is female-centered. Within it, birth is something that women do—not something that happens to them. The birth-giving woman is the central agent in the ancient drama of life bringing forth new life. The midwifery model of care recognizes the essential oneness of mind and body and the power of women in the creation of new life.

Women's feelings to the baby's feelings

> When the woman’s emotional needs are fulfilled, there is less risk for the baby. The reality is that the baby has no choice but to feel what the mother feels.

Nutrition and companionship

> The midwifery model of care recognizes the importance of **good nutrition as the best way to prevent the most common complications of pregnancy**. It emphasizes the **importance of companionship and encouragement during labor** as a way to minimize technological intervention in the birth process.

Progressing labour and medical intervention when required

> A laboring woman **may move around freely, drink, eat, and be sexually playful with her partner** within this model (if that is what best stimulates her labor). All of these activities help labor to progress. The midwifery model of maternity care, of course, recognizes that medical intervention is sometimes necessary and that it should be applied in these particular cases.

Techno-centric birth

> Pregnancy and labor are seen as illnesses, which, in order not to be harmful to mother or baby, **must be treated with drugs and medical equipment**. Within the techno-medical model of birth, some medical intervention is considered necessary for every birth, and birth is safe only in retrospect. According to this model, once labor starts, birth must take place within twenty-four hours.

Normal vaginal birth in techno-medical birth

> Where the techno-medical model of birth reigns, **women who give birth vaginally generally labor in bed hooked up to electronic fetal monitors, intravenous tubes, and pressure-reading devices**. Eating and drinking in labor are usually not permitted. Labor pain within this model is seen as unacceptable, so **analgesia and anesthesia are encouraged**.

Episiotomy

> Episiotomies (the surgical cut to enlarge the vaginal opening) **are no longer as routinely done as they were** during the twentieth century; this is one area in which birth activism and good evidence have made some beneficial change.

Nutrition during pregnancy is important!

> According to the midwifery model, one of the most important things that you can do during pregnancy to be healthy and to prevent complications is to eat a nutritious diet. Through eating and drinking well, you will give yourself and your baby some of the best pregnancy insurance possible.

Eating well

> So eat well. This means eat food. Avoid eating anything that isn’t food, such as preservatives, chemical additives, and anything that nature didn’t produce. Read labels. The same goes for what you drink. If you are addicted to carbonated, sweet beverages, swear off them during pregnancy and breast-feeding and drink water.

Squatting

> if you are pregnant or planning to be, I suggest **daily squatting as part of your morning routine**. Start with ten on the first day and increase that number as the days pass. Three hundred a day would not be too many. I have noticed that **first-time mothers over thirty tend to have shorter labors** since I began sharing the virtues of squatting.

Posture!

> The postures that you take in the last months of pregnancy are your best way to help your baby find the easier positions for labor and birth. This is true especially during the last four weeks of pregnancy.

Baby's heads down but facing front (OP)

> During the last weeks of pregnancy, his **head has pressed against mother’s cervix, helping to make it soft and pliable even before labor begins**. This development is less likely to happen when the baby is in the occiput posterior (OP) position, which means that the back of baby’s head (occiput) is near mother’s back (posterior).

How does mother's abdomen look like in OP position

> In the case of the OP baby, the mother’s abdomen has a sort of plateau at its highest point as she is lying on her back; it even becomes a bit concave (because the baby’s arms and legs are in front, instead of the long, smooth contour of the baby’s back).

Postures that (might?? maybe???) help in bringing the baby to the right position

> Squat instead of bending over when you pick up something off the floor. You are much less likely to strain your back muscles if you form this good habit in pregnancy. Watching television while kneeling on the floor or leaning over a bean bag are two excellent postures for encouraging a favorable presentation or increasing the likelihood of correcting an OP position if that is how your baby is lying.

Sleeping to correct OP

> If your baby is OP, sleep on your side, with your uppermost leg forward so your knee reaches the mattress. Gravity will naturally encourage your baby to move to the most advantageous position.

## Medical conditions and tests

Gestational diabetes

> Gestational diabetes (GD) is not really a disease. Rather, it is a higher level of blood sugar (glucose) than average during pregnancy, as determined by a glucose tolerance test (GTT). It differs from diabetes mellitus in that GD goes away after the baby is born. Diabetes mellitus does not.

Rh-positive or Rh-negative

> As part of your prenatal care, you should have a blood test to determine whether your blood type is rhesus-positive or rhesus-negative (Rh-positive or Rh-negative). Eighty-five percent of Caucasians have Rh-positive blood, while the remaining 15 percent have Rh-negative blood.

## Labour

First birth and labour

> If this is your first labor, you have no reference point for how intense labor must become before your cervix is dilating more than a tiny bit. **You may lean toward traveling to your birthplace-to-be as early in labor as possible**—if you like things being organized. Who wants to give birth in a car?

Progressing through labour at home by napping

> It may help to know that labor often starts and stops a time or two before it becomes powerful enough to complete the birth process. This situation is most likely to happen in the early or latent phase of labor. If you think you are in labor and it’s late in the day, try taking a warm bath, drinking a glass of wine, and going to bed for a while. **You may be able to take a nap before labor becomes intense.** This is a good thing, as it reduces the likelihood of a stalled labor once you get to the hospital, it **conserves your energy, and you may even make some real progress in labor as you doze**.

Hospitals and labour

> Before the use of induction drugs became common, most hospital maternity wards sent women in early labor home if labor was not well established. Laboring women walked the halls if their rushes weren’t strong enough to thin or dilate the cervix. Nowadays, many hospital maternity wards discourage you from leaving once you are admitted, even if your labor has effectively stopped.

Latent vs active labour

> A long latent phase of labor can interfere with your sleep or your ability to go on with your usual life if you confuse latent phase contractions with those of active labor, which have both the regularity and intensity to open your cervix. Taking catnaps when necessary and staying on your feet the rest of the time (whether dancing or doing some task that you care about and want to finish) are good ways to move through the prodromal phase.

Stay at home during latent phase of labour

> women should be encouraged to stay home during the latent phase in order to avoid unnecessary medical interventions such as epidurals, electronic fetal monitoring, oxytocin augmentation, and cesarean section.

A huge percentage of women get admitted to the hospital during latent stage of labour

> Canadian study showed that 45 percent of women were not in active labor when they were admitted to the hospital.

Induction to labour only when required

> What bewilders me is the mother who has not asked for induction, does not desire induction, has no medical indication for induction, and is scheduled for induction. It is not that she relinquished choice—she can refuse—but this voice may not be known to her.

Cons of induction

> Let us not forget that **induced patients are usually continuously monitored, have a higher epidural utilization rate than natural onset, have IVs running, and are basically confined to the bed**. This is not natural. After twenty-six years, I have noticed that persistent occiput posterior presentations and C-sections for failure to progress are much higher in the women who get early epidurals than in the ones who move about.

Labour and pushing

> She must remember that natural labor onset always wins. That letting her body do its job gives time for natural endorphins to control her pain. That she needs to move during labor. Get up, walk, labor in the tub or shower, or on a ball. **Labor and push in a position that is comfortable rather than convenient**. Know about intermittent monitoring, not having a running IV, and being allowed nourishment.

## Induced labour

Rate of induced labour should be less than 1 in 10 women giving birth!

> A consensus meeting organized by the World Health Organization on appropriate technology for birth held in Fortaleza, Brazil, in 1985 recommended that “no geographic region should have **rates of induced labor over ten percent**.”

More pain in chemically induced labour

> Women tend to have harsher, stronger, significantly more painful contractions with chemically induced labors, so one who can cope with a spontaneous labor often finds that she needs pain medication to bear the more insistent contractions of an induced one. There is no shame in needing pain medication in a chemically induced labor.

Higher fetal distress in induced labour

> **when induction is purely elective, there is a higher incidence of fetal distress than in labors that begin spontaneously**. Oxytocin and prostaglandin inductions, the most common methods in use, are well known to **cause longer, more intense uterine contractions**, sometimes to the point of interfering with the flow of oxygen-rich blood from the placenta to the baby.

Cons of continuous fetal monitoring

> For the fetal monitoring equipment to automatically record the fetal heartbeat, the mother must lie still in bed. If she wants a little more mobility, she may choose to have an internal scalp electrode needle inserted into the baby’s scalp, but this is painful to the baby, requires breaking the water bag, and can cause infection in both mother and baby.

Amniotomy

> Amniotomy alone is drug-free and inexpensive. It means to deliberately tear open the amniotic sac with a sterile instrument resembling a long crochet hook so that the fluid may flow out.

Cons of oxytocin-induced labour

> An **oxytocin-induced labor is twice as likely as a spontaneous labor to result in an instrumental delivery or a cesarean section**, usually because of **fetal distress stemming from harder, longer uterine contractions** that interfere with the flow of oxygen-rich blood from mother to baby.

Intravenous oxytocin

> Intravenous oxytocin induction means that the laboring woman’s mobility may be restricted because of the discomfort caused by the IV needle in her vein and the tubes that attach her to the IV stand.

Prostin E2

> Prostin E2 is a tablet placed in the vagina. These drugs are often used in conjunction with oxytocin. Some women experience nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea under the influence of these drugs. More serious side effects can occur as well:

Tablet

> Administer it early in the morning, and the baby will be out before dark in most cases. It’s cheap. In tablet form, it costs cents, compared with hundreds of dollars for other methods. It has become the busy maternity ward’s tool to keep laboring women with long labors from clogging up the system. Most of the time it doesn’t harm either mother or baby.

Semen with prostaglandin

> Human semen is the most concentrated source of prostaglandins, the substance that all of the chemical prostaglandin products mimic. It’s free and can be received with pleasure. Intercourse during the last weeks of pregnancy actually helps to prepare the woman’s body to go into labor.

Castor oil

> Indigenous people all over the globe have used castor oil to induce labor for centuries. Taken orally, castor oil acts as a laxative, and the stimulation of the digestive tract often starts labor at term.

## Fetal distress

Fetal monitoring

> Hospitals began using EFM before there was any evidence to back up this assumption, and EFM became routine in most. What it did not do is make any noticeable reduction in neonatal mortality. Research done since then shows that **intermittent monitoring in most cases is equally good at detecting a baby in distress**.

Oxygen deprivation

> Generally, **in natural labors, uterine contractions don’t last long enough to cause damage from oxygen deprivation**. If a baby is oxygen-deprived, the pattern of the heartbeat will usually change.

False alerts on cesarean

> Someone misinterprets the tracings on the printout, orders an emergency cesarean, and a perfectly healthy baby is born, showing no sign of distress. The mother, however, has to recover from surgery that could have been avoided.

intermittent baby's heart rate checking is better

> Continuous EFM may be routine at many hospitals, but good evidence that it should be mandatory is lacking. We know that it slows labor, **increases the incidence of fetal distress, increases pain, makes it harder to refuse vaginal exams, and forces the uterus to work against gravity**. For all these reasons, it’s good to stay on your feet and insist on intermittent checks of your baby’s heart rate.

Food and drinking during labour

> If you have a labor lasting more than five or six hours, you may get hungry. Lots of women want to drink or eat in labor, but many hospitals try to restrict eating and drinking once you have been admitted. The reasons for this are historic, not scientific. The fear is that if a woman should need a cesarean under general anesthesia (which is not likely to be used anymore), she might vomit and inhale some of the vomit into her lungs while unconscious.

IV instead of food and drinks

> Hospitals that try to keep women from eating and drinking during labor generally want every woman to receive IV fluids. Large volumes of IV fluids can cause respiratory distress and seizures in newborns, because they cause low blood sugar and low blood sodium.

Eating and drinking decision is left to the woman

> Dutch study found that 80 to 85 percent of Dutch midwives and obstetricians leave the decision of eating and drinking in labor to the women themselves.

Food and drinks to feel strong

> In these cases, the woman experienced an almost immediate benefit after taking a little nourishment. Her contractions almost instantly resumed their former vigor, and she gained enough strength to push her baby out when it had previously appeared that she wouldn’t be able to do this.

Breathing well and drinking

> Drinking fluids is more necessary than eating for most women. **Many breathe through their mouths during the most intense phase of labor**, so that a drink every now and then is a welcome relief. I like to keep water and electrolyte-balancing drinks available to each woman, and she chooses what is most appealing to her.

## Moving around

Movement is good!

> Wherever you intend to give birth, it is good to know that most women in labor need to be able to change position and to move around freely. **Movement greatly helps cervical dilation during the early part of labor** and helps bring the baby into the most advantageous position for passage through the pelvis.

Moving with tools

> You may want to **sit on your partner’s lap, a birth stool, a birth ball, or the toilet**. Maybe you’ll feel like dancing. **Slow dancing, figure-eight belly dance moves, the hula** — all of these may help your baby find the best exit.

Choosing upright position for birth

> Women in traditional societies all over the world almost always choose upright positions in labor. This worldwide consensus suggests that women don’t choose to lie down to labor and give birth unless forces within their culture pressure them into doing so.

Common positions for birth

> The labor postures common to traditional women’s cultures all over the world include **sitting, kneeling, standing, squatting, or the hands-and-knees position**.

Using gravity

> benefits of upright positions in labor includes: **better use of gravity** maximum circulation between mother and baby

When did lie on backs position start?

> In 1668, François Mauriceau published a treatise on midwifery that recommended that women lie on their backs for giving birth. This recommendation was made for the **benefit of the physician or man-midwife who might want to use forceps**, not for the benefit of the laboring woman herself.

Why is squatting position no longer seen in birth?

> By the end of the nineteenth century, birth chairs were rarely used any longer. “Fashionable” ladies expected to lie down to have their babies. **Giving birth in a squatting position came to be considered low-class**—far from “ladylike.” Given this history, it is not an exaggeration to call the supine position an invention of the industrial revolution. It is a male-derived position—one invented for the convenience of the birth attendant.

## Medicated pain relief

Tranquilizer

> There are no advantages to taking tranquilizers during labor. Tranquilizers (Valium is the most commonly used) are supposed to reduce anxiety and tension, but **they cross the placenta and interfere with the baby’s ability to breathe**, to suck, and to maintain a healthy muscle tension (tranquilized newborns tend to be limp).

Nitrous oxide

> Nitrous oxide combinations have been used in Britain for many years to dull labor pain, in both hospital and home births. Women inhale the gas through a mask they hold tightly to their nose and mouth during the peak of a contraction. The **effects are immediate and short-lived. No obvious side effects have been found in babies**. A disadvantage of this method is that it takes a certain amount of effort to show the woman how to use the mask effectively, and some women don’t like the mask.

Epidural

> Epidural anesthesia does have several side effects: Sometimes it causes a dramatic drop in blood pressure, which can put both mother and baby at risk

- In about one woman in every five, the epidural causes a fever
- Epidurals don’t always work. Even when the epidural is given correctly, it does not provide pain relief in about 3 percent of women.
- Babies whose mothers have had epidurals sometimes have breathing difficulties and a difficult time establishing breast-feeding
- Very rarely (one in 5,000 cases or so), an epidural can result in a maternal death or permanent paralysis.

General anesthesia

> General anesthesia was once the preferred form of obstetric anesthesia, but it was abandoned, for the most part, when the epidural came on the scene. General anesthesia has a comparatively high hazard of producing breathing difficulties in babies.

Spinal anesthesia

> Spinal anesthesia is similar to epidural anesthesia: An intravenous infusion is first set up, and then a local anesthetic is put in through a needle in the back. The pain relief it provides for cesarean section is as good as an epidural, sometimes better. However, a catheter is not left in place, so the anesthesia can last only so long.

## Preparing for unmedicated birth

> There are many good reasons for choosing to give birth in a hospital. That choice is yours. Maybe you are sure that you will feel safer about giving birth in a hospital, but **you want to maximize your chances of having an unmedicated labor and birth experience**. I have some suggestions.

Doula

> The evidence in favor of doulas comes from more than eleven carefully designed studies: Quite simply, hiring one cuts in half the odds of your having an unnecessary cesarean. It also halves the odds of your having a forceps or vacuum-extractor delivery. That’s not all! Having a doula also shortens labor by greatly reducing stress, pain, and anxiety.

Drink and pee

> Be sure to drink a few swallows every hour while in labor and get up to pee every hour or so. Drinking to thirst will prevent dehydration as you labor. It also prompts the need to pee, which will send you to the toilet... make sure that your bladder is empty before you begin pushing.

Using warm water bath

> The other useful kind is to get into a shower or, better, to immerse yourself in a deep tub of comfortably warm water (if your water bag has not broken). **Most women get immediate pain relief from hydrotherapy. Being in water is calming and relaxing.**

Breast stimulation

> He began trying to study how breast stimulation might be used to lower the 30 percent rate of oxytocin augmentation at his hospital. He learned that this method had been used traditionally for centuries to augment labor in ethnic groups from many different areas of the world

intravenous Pitocin

> If you will give birth in an institution where the medical model is particularly strong, and your labor slows down, you are more likely to be offered intravenous Pitocin to stimulate labor than to be encouraged to do breast stimulation. In those where the midwifery model has some respect, breast stimulation will be suggested before drugs are brought up, as breast stimulation is less invasive than drugs.

Darken lights

> What is needed for effective labor with **lowered levels of stress hormones is a comfortable, dimly lit, cozy space** that allows you to access the part of your primitive brain that sets up the process of hormonal ebb and flow and facilitates the smoothest functioning of the normal birth process.

Massages

> I was greatly helped by **thigh massage and by hand pressure against my lower back**. I found both heavenly during labor.

Meditation

> The only thing that Judy did differently from other women I have helped in labor was to concentrate on that mantra as she pushed. One thing about a meditation like this is that you can use it without worrying about negative side effects, so it can’t hurt you to try it.

Episiotomy

> Episiotomies: cause pain that sometimes lasts for weeks or months increase blood loss cause more serious tears because a cut perineum is not as resistant to laceration as an intact one often become infected are associated with wound breakdown, abscesses, permanent damage to the pelvic-floor muscles, and other complications that do cause incontinence (for example, rectovaginal fistulas—openings between the vagina and the rectum) prevent many women from breast-feeding because of the pain they cause

## Birth

Babies head advancing and receding slightly

> It may help you to know that first babies’ heads normally advance toward birth during a push and then recede once that push is over. Women who don’t understand this process sometimes think that they are going backward when the baby’s head recedes between pushes. I explain then that this process is good, because it **helps the vulva gradually attain the size necessary for birth**. Circulation to the area increases with the alternate stimuli of pressure, release, pressure, release.

Baby lying on the belly

> Many new mothers like the feeling of the **baby lying belly-to-belly** with them; this works well especially when the cord is relatively short. Don’t worry if there’s a thin layer of cloth between you. A warm blanket over the baby is all that’s necessary while you are cuddling your newborn.

Placenta ejection

> My observation is that the stimulation provided by the baby’s movements triggers good uterine contractions, exactly what is needed for timely detachment of the placenta from the uterine wall.

Delayed cord-clamping

> Studies have shown that delayed cord-clamping allows 40 percent of the baby’s blood volume to flow into the baby from the mother. Early cord-clamping definitely results in lower hematocrit or hemoglobin values in the newborn. Premature babies especially benefit from later cord-clamping.

Get in upright position for placenta expulsion

> If a mother is lying down after birth, has been holding her baby for fifteen or twenty minutes, and the placenta has separated but not yet been expelled, it’s good for her to get into an upright position

Keeping the baby warm

> There will be an effort to keep your baby warm. Hospitals are sometimes rather chilly places, and wet newborns (they never arrive dry!) can quickly lose body heat. **A nice place for your baby to land is your abdomen or chest, to be covered with a warmed receiving blanket.**

Newborn complications

> Newborn complications can happen, no matter how perfectly you behaved throughout your pregnancy. It isn’t necessary or helpful to blame anyone—including yourself—when this happens or to feel that the two of you will be less close with each other because you missed something too special to ever be replaced.

In case holding the newborn is not possible!

> Don’t worry about bonding with your baby (and forgive yourself if you do turn to worrying!)—that you missed something irretrievable in that hour or two just after birth when you were not able to hold and cuddle your baby. Life will be full of opportunities ahead for you to gain the feeling of full connection with your little one.

## After the birth

Plan to rest on bed!

> **Plan to spend most of your time on your bed with your new baby**. Why? You need to take it easy, that’s why. Your internal organs are rearranging themselves, as you make the transition between pregnancy and fresh motherhood.

Tiredness and learning

> You will probably be more tired than ever before in your life. A major accomplishment in an entire day might be brushing your hair or taking a shower. You are learning to be a mother, and you may be your own harshest critic.

Take time for the transition

> Stay close to home, don’t entertain, and rest. This is your best way to **prevent extra bleeding and the emotional-physical crash** that often follows being up and around too early. There are lots of good reasons why traditional cultures all over the world respect the need for new mothers to take some time to **allow their bodies to make the transition from pregnancy to new motherhood**.

Postpartum depression

> Postpartum depression (PPD) occurs in as many as 20 to 30 percent of mothers in the United States. My observation is that the incidence is far less in societies in which there is greater social support for new parents. Typical symptoms include **feelings of guilt, hopelessness, and despair, insomnia, difficulty focusing, feelings of inadequacy, irrational concern about the baby’s well-being, nightmares, and persistent thoughts of hurting oneself or the baby**.

Risk of blood clots

> Pregnant women and new mothers are subject to the same risk because of the higher clotting factors in their blood around the time of birth. The risk is higher for those who have been on bed rest or who have had cesareans.

## Birth complications

Placenta previa

> The next case of placenta previa she faced was case number 1,250, and she executed her plan of delivering the woman as soon as possible. Like Louise Bourgeois, the famous French midwife of the previous century, she **removed the placenta first, then turned the baby to a feet first position and pulled him out**. Mother and child were both saved in this case, as well as in seven of the other ten cases.

Some body techniques during labour

> The second set of techniques (**upright birth postures, pulling on overhead straps or bars while pushing the baby down, breast stimulation to contract the uterus, and the all-fours position** for resolving shoulder dystocia, for instance) are all found in cultures where indigenous midwifery survives.

Cesarean rates vary!

> According to a 2013 report, the cesarean rate in the United States varies widely, with hospital rates as low as 7.1 percent and as high as 69.9 percent. Such extreme variation strongly suggests that **there are reasons besides the safety of the mother and baby that influence whether a cesarean is done or not**.

Cesarean reasons: medical or other

> Part of preparing to give birth in the twenty-first century involves gaining an understanding of two categories of cesareans: those that are **needed for medical reasons and those performed for other reasons**.

## Medical complications

Medical reasons for cesarean

1. Placenta previa
1. Prolapse of cord
1. Placenta abruption
1. Face presentation in which the chin of the baby is lying toward the mother’s tailbone
1. Frank breech presentation
1. Brow presentation where forehead of the baby leads into the pelvis
1. Transverse lie during labor (the baby is lying sideways in the uterus and can’t be turned) and shoulder or arm presentation (if the baby’s position can’t be corrected)
1. Cardiac arrest in the mother is another indication for emergency cesarean
1. Placenta accreta, increta, and percreta are severe placental abnormalities in which the placenta grows over a prior uterine scar or into the uterine wall
1. True fetal distress (a heart rate below 120 beats per minute) with meconium is an indication for instrumental delivery or cesarean unless birth is imminent
1. Uterine fibroids or ovarian cysts fall into the debatable category for cesarean, depending upon their size and location. Unless they are very large and low, such growths will not usually block the baby’s exit
1. A previous rupture of the anal sphincter

Continous monitoring of fetal heart

> A randomized controlled trial in women who had previous cesareans compared intermittent monitoring of the fetal heart to continuous monitoring; the intermittent group had a higher vaginal birth rate without any impact on perinatal outcome.

Normal cervix dilation rate

> The document suggests that recent evidence has overturned the previous long-held idea that every first-time mother’s cervix should dilate at a rate of 1.2 centimeters per hour when larger, more recent studies have put the **rate at 0.5 centimeter**.

Common causes of death before and today

> Three decades ago, the major causes of maternal deaths in childbirth were **hemorrhage and pregnancy-induced spikes in blood pressure**. Chronic diseases such as **diabetes and heart disease** are now among the major causes of maternal deaths, while rates of death from hemorrhage, hypertension, and infection are lower than they were a generation ago.

Delayed pregnancy does not cause rise in death rates

> At the same time, the trend of delayed pregnancy is also going on in other well-resourced countries, without their maternal death rates rising.

X-Rays are no longer used

> Prenatal X-rays were used for half a century before a researcher found in the mid-1950s that they significantly **increase the rate of childhood cancers**.

Ban DES

> The FDA banned DES for use in pregnant women in 1971, after it was found to be the cause of rare vaginal cancers in young women as well as genital abnormalities in both young women and men whose mothers were given the drug.

Misoprostol

> The use of Cytotec (misoprostol) has spread to European countries as well. I was not surprised to read a case report published by two Danish midwives whose goal was to highlight that misoprostol, even when used in small doses on an unscarred uterus, might **cause uterine rupture**.

Chemical induction of labour

> Could it be that the frequency of AFE is rising as the number of induced labors increases? We don’t know for sure. Until we have better research available, it would seem wise to **avoid chemical induction of labor** whenever possible.

Double layer closure after cesarean

> My recommendation to pregnant women—at least in the United States—is to specify that if you should need a cesarean, you want your uterus to be closed in two layers. If you have already had a cesarean and are pregnant again, **make sure that your placenta is not overlying your previous uterine scar before you go for a vaginal birth after cesarean**.

VBAC worth considering

> Even so, most physicians advised women not to have more than three children by cesarean and stuck with the warning that the lower rupture rate was not sufficient to make **vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) worth considering**.

Limiting cesarean births

> In 1995, ACOG’s VBAC Practice Patterns bulletin had recommended **limiting repeat cesarean births to those that were medically necessary**. Obstetricians should counsel and encourage women to try to give birth vaginally, it said, as this would lead to **shorter hospital stays, fewer transfusions, fewer postpartum fevers, and a savings** of more than $4,000 per birth.

##

Time for cervix dilation

> If there is pressure for you to dilate more quickly, **get into water or walk and arrange for privacy**. Make sure **you are well fed before you get to the hospital** (if that’s where you plan to give birth). Try to find one where you can eat and drink during labor if you want.

Questions to ask the labour or ob-gyn

- Can my baby’s heart rate be intermittently monitored?
- Do you do episiotomies routinely?
- How do you feel about my eating and drinking in labor?
- If I go into labor, come to the hospital, and then it slows down, can I go home? Can I walk around during labor?
- Are you willing to leave the umbilical cord intact for several minutes after birth? Can I have my baby on my chest after birth?
- Do you use pharmaceutical products to induce labor?
- Are there tubs or showers that I can use in labor at the hospital?

New-age hospitals!

> No longer are babies’ fathers routinely barred from being present during labor and birth or first-time mothers routinely compelled to have huge episiotomies and forceps deliveries. Some hospitals have installed tubs in birth rooms as a strategy for lowering epidural rates.

Checklist for hospitals

- Provides accurate descriptive and statistical information to the public about its practices and procedures for birth care, including measures of interventions and outcomes.
- Provides culturally competent care—that is, care that is sensitive and responsive to the specific beliefs, values, and customs of the mother’s ethnicity and religion.
- Provides the birthing woman with the freedom to walk, move about, and assume the positions of her choice during labor and birth (unless restriction is specifically required to correct a complication), and discourages the use of the lithotomy (flat on the back with legs elevated) position.
- Educates staff in non-drug methods of pain relief, and does not promote the use of analgesic or anesthetic drugs not specifically required to correct a complication.
