**Some extracts:** long-term perspective...

> People with long term perspective... are invariably more successful than people with only a short-term outlook. People with long-term perspective make their day-to-day decisions based on where they want to be in many years in the future. As a result, they make decisions today that are more likely to assure that they create the future they truly desire. the rule is: long term thinking improves short-term decision making
