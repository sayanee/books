[Think and Grow Rich](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_and_Grow_Rich) - A great book. It was written in 1937 just at the end of the Great Depression. I liked it and if you wanna read it for free, just [download the eBook](http://www.zilliontech.com/knowledge/thinkandgrowrich.html) or [read from a blog ](http://think-and-grow-rich-book.blogspot.com/)or [another website](http://www.absolute1.net/napoleon-hill-think-and-grow-rich.html) :D

Like any book that teaches us about Personal mastery, it always gives us many examples of role models. So instead of giving examples of Trump or Buffet, i read here about [Thomas Edison ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison)(electricity), [Graham Bell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Bell) (telephone), [Marconi ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guglielmo_Marconi)(radio) and [Henry Ford](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ford) (Ford Motors). The examples were all shifted back in time and yet the principles taught were powerfully timeless!

i read a paragraph about the value of prayer and belief...

> The subconscious mind in the intermediary, which translates ones's prayers into terms which Infinite Intelligence can recognise, presents the message, and bring back the answer in the form of a definite plan or idea for procuring the object of the prayer. Understand this principle and you will know why mere words read from a prayer book cannot and will never serve as an agency of communication between the mind of man and Infinite Intelligence.
