> Many religions have a belief in the supernatural. This may be a belief in God or in supernatural forces. Some ask for a belief in many gods. in H+ there is only a belief in the potential of yourself and in the potential of your fellow human beings. H+ sets a framework for the development of this potential. You can belief that you ca act in a certain way or that you will eventually be able to act in this way.

How is H+ different?

> Most religions focus on avoiding sins and wrongdoing. .. There is no intrinsic belief system in H+ expect the belief in yourself – not necessarily as you are but as you can be. At the same time a any belief system belonging to another religion is fully acceptable. This is unlike most religions that do not tolerate other belief systems.

Rituals…

> The value of ritual is that it involves self-discipline and belonging. The ritual is pointless in itself so the doing of it is purely a matter of discipline and the willingness to do it. It is an active affirmation of your belonging. The ritual is a visible signal to yourself and to others that you belong, on some way, to a group. Each time you carry out the ritual you are saying to yourself, “I belong”.
