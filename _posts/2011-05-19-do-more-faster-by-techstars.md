- combine sheer will, determination and focus to make it happen with a healthy sense of urgency
- have a perspective that things rarely go as planned

Email...

1. use the subject line
2. 3 sentence rule
3. spell check
4. reply to important emails right away
5. use "unread" status
6. be conscious of how much you suck - if you send out emails that you consider are important and you don't get a response, think about why

deadly strategic mistakes:

1. built a sales effort, but too weak of a product
2. waited too long to address the "nice to have" problem
3. went after enterprise sales model with non-recurring small price

deadly cultural mistake

1. didin't focus on learning and failing fast
2. didn't care about or focus enough about discovering how to market
3. in hiring, choosing expediency over talent and competency

5 key metrics to measure by Dave McClure:

1. Acquisition - how are users coming to your site through various channels?
2. Activation - Are users happy with their first experience?
3. Retention - Are users coming back?
4. Referral - Are users telling others?
5. Revenue - Are users spending money or allowing you to monetise?
