- **Some extracts**:

on getting far:

> To achieve your goals in life, I realized, it matters less how smart you are, how much innate talent you're born with, or even, most eyeopening to me, where you came from and how much you started out with. Sure all these are important, but they mean little if you don't understand one thing: You can't get there alone. In fact, you can't get very far at all.

getting info:

> There are two aspects to getting good information. One part comes from within you; the other part comes from those around you.

on people:

> Our strength comes from what we do and know cumulatively. The fact is, no one gets ahead in thisÂ world without a lot of help. Eliminating things like intimidation and manipulation, there is only one way to get anybody to do anything. Do you know what it is? This is far from a trivial question. Business is, after all, the ability to motivate a group of individuals to move an idea from concept to reality; to take a theory and make it a practice; to gain the buy-in of your employees and colleagues; to encourage others to execute your plans.
