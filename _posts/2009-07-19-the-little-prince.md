- **Some extracts**:

secret

> "Here is my secret. It is very simple: one sees well only with the heart. The essential is invisible to the eyes."

truth

> “People have forgotten this truth,” said the fox. “But you mustn’t forget it. You become responsible forever for what you’ve tamed. You’re responsible for you rose…”

beauty

> “The stars are beautiful because of a flower you don’t see…”

blind

> "The men where you live," said the little prince, "raise five thousand roses in the same garden — and they do not find in it what they are looking for." "They do not find it," I replied. "And yet what they are looking for could be found in one single rose, or in a little water." "Yes, that is true," I said. And the little prince added: "But the eyes are blind. One must look with the heart..."

mystery

> Here, then, is a great mystery. For you who also love the little prince, and for me, nothing in the universe can be the same if somewhere, we do not know where, a sheep that we never saw has — yes or no? — eaten a rose... Look up at the sky. Ask yourselves: is it yes or no? Has the sheep eaten the flower? And you will see how everything changes... And no grown-up will ever understand that this is a matter of so much importance!
