Nikola Tesla writes this at the age of 63 after a deep career and work in the field of electricity and mechanics.

Why invent? Why for me and others...

> The progressive development of man is vitally dependent on invention. It is the **most important product of his creative brain**. Its ultimate purpose is the **complete mastery of mind over the material world**, the **harnessing of the forces of nature to human needs**.

Never a sacrifice, but enjoyment

> Every effort under compulsion demands a sacrifice of life-energy. I never paid such a price. On the contrary, I have thrived on my thoughts.

Early excitements channeled into discipline and focus with training

> Our first endeavors are purely instinctive, promptings of an **imagination vivid and undisciplined**. As we grow older reason asserts itself and we become more and more **systematic and designing**. But those **early impulses, tho not immediately productive**, are of the greatest moment and may shape our very destinies.

Late awakening was what Tesla had... yes it is never too late.

> There was another and still more important reason for my late awakening.

Free-reign of mind, sounds very much to what I read in Einstein's biography

> I soon discovered that my best comfort was attained if I simply went on in my vision farther and farther, getting new impressions all the time, and so I began to **travel of course, in my mind**.

Again reminded me of Einstein - traveling on the light bean

> Then I observed to my delight that **I could visualize with the greatest facility**. I needed no models, drawings or experiments. I could picture them all as real in my mind. Thus I have been led unconsciously to evolve what I consider a new method of materializing inventive concepts and ideas, **which is radically opposite to the purely experimental** and is in my opinion ever so **much more expeditious and efficient**.

First thought and then the steps

> My method is different. **I do not rush into actual work**. When I get an idea I start at once **building it up in my imagination**. I change the construction, make improvements and operate the device in my mind. It is absolutely immaterial to me whether I run my turbine in thought or test it in my shop.

Everything is maths

> Engineering, electrical and mechanical, is positive in results. There is **scarcely a subject that cannot be mathematically treated** and the effects calculated or the results determined beforehand from the available theoretical and practical data.

Obstacles to knowing who we truly are. Remember Steve Jobs? "*Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice.*"

> The **pressure of occupation** and the **incessant stream of impressions** pouring into our consciousness thru all the gateways of knowledge **make modern existence hazardous in many ways**. Most persons are so absorbed in the contemplation of the outside world that they are wholly oblivious to what is passing on within themselves.

Qualities of an inventor

> An inventor's endeavor is essentially lifesaving. Whether he harnesses forces, improves devices, or provides new comforts and conveniences, he is **adding to the safety of our existence**. He is also better qualified than the average individual to protect himself in peril, for he is **observant and resourceful**.

From imagination to reality and years in between

> I constructed many of these and found great pleasure in operating them. How extraordinary was my life an incident may illustrate. My uncle had no use for this kind of pastime and more than once rebuked me. I was fascinated by a description of Niagara Falls I had perused, and pictured in my imagination a big wheel run by the Falls. I told my uncle that I would go to America and carry out this scheme. Thirty years later I saw my ideas carried out at Niagara and **marveled at the unfathomable mystery of the mind**.

Schooling and compulsion... why??

> It was a serious handicap as under the then existing educational regime, drawing being obligatory, this deficiency threatened to spoil my whole career and my father had considerable trouble in railroading me from one class to another.

An avid reader ... why am i not surprised!

> During this period **I was permitted to read constantly**, obtaining books from the Public Library which had been neglected and entrusted to me for classification of the works and preparation of the catalogues. One day I was handed a few volumes of new literature unlike anything I had ever read before and so captivating as to make me utterly forget my hopeless state. They were the earlier works of Mark Twain and to them might have been due the miraculous recovery which followed.

Interest in electricity

> I had become intensely interested in electricity under the stimulating influence of my Professor of Physics, who was an ingenious man and often **demonstrated the principles by apparatus of his own invention**. Among these I recall a device in the shape of a freely rotatable bulb, with tinfoil coatings, which was made to spin rapidly when connected to a static machine.

Acute curiosity

> Every impression produced a thousand echoes in my mind. **I wanted to know more of this wonderful force**; I longed for **experiment and investigation** and resigned myself to the inevitable with aching heart.

Making inventions for the public

> Subsequent reflections, however, on the resistance of pipes to fluid flow **determined me to make this invention public property**.

Finish what you begin

> Thereafter I devoted myself chiefly to **physics, mechanics and mathematical studies**, spending the hours of leisure in the libraries. **I had a veritable rnania for finishing whatever I began**, which often got me into difficulties. On one occasion I started to read the works of Voltaire when I learned, to my dismay, that there were close on one hundred large volumes in small print which that monster had written while drinking seventy-two cups of black coffee per diem. It had to be done, but when I laid aside the last book I was very glad, and said, "Never more!"

Instinct vs knowledge

> But **instinct is something which transcends knowledge**. We have, undoubtedly, certain finer fibers that enable us to perceive truths when logical deduction, or any other willful effort of the brain, is futile.

Boldness to begin a task

> For a time I wavered, imprest by the professor's authority, but soon became convinced I was right and **undertook the task with all the fire and boundless confidence of youth**.

38 years of unstopping work

> Can anyone believe that so hopeless a physical wreck could ever be transformed into a man of astonishing strength and tenacity, **able to work thirty-eight years almost without a day's interruption**, and find himself still strong and fresh in body and mind? Such is my case. **A powerful desire to live and to continue the work**, and the assistance of a devoted friend and athlete accomplished the wonder.

Enjoyment of coming in ideas

> For a while I gave myself up entirely to the **intense enjoyment of picturing machines and devising new forms**. It was a mental state of happiness about as complete as I have ever known in life. **Ideas came in an uninterrupted stream** and the only difficulty I had was to hold them fast.

I call this momentum

> I delighted in imagining the motors constantly running, for in this way they presented to mind's eye a more fascinating sight. **When natural inclination develops into a passionate desire, one advances towards his goal in seven-league boots**. In less than two months I evolved virtually all the types of motors and modifications of the system which are now identified with my name.

Meeting Edison

> The meeting with Edison was a memorable event in my life. I was amazed at this wonderful man who, without early advantages and scientific training, had accomplished so much.

Any new field will be unfamiliar and difficult

> The **problems of construction in this unexplored field were novel and quite peculiar and I encountered many difficulties**. I rejected the inductor type, fearing that it might not yield perfect sine waves which were so important to resonant action.

What shapes destiny - influences!

> As I review the events of my past life I realize how subtle are the influences that shape our destinies.

Same story, unchanged today - resistence to change and maintain the status quo

> It is a radical departure in the sense that its **success would mean the abandonment of the antiquated types** of prime movers on which billions of dollars have been spent. Under such circumstances the progress must needs be slow and perhaps the greatest impediment is encountered in the **prejudicial opinions created in the minds of experts by organized opposition**.

Work on the next small step in a direction

> These and other inventions of mine, however, were **nothing more than steps forward in certain directions**. In evolving them I simply **followed the inborn sense to improve** the present devices **without any special thought** of our far more imperative necessities.

What happened with inventions

> The **wonders of yesterday are today common occurrences**. When my tubes were first publicly exhibited they were viewed with amazement impossible to describe. From all parts of the world I received urgent invitations and numerous honors and other flattering inducements were offered to me, which I declined.

Does the best invention always thrive?

> My project was retarded by laws of nature. The world was not prepared for it. It was **too far ahead of time**. But the same **laws will prevail in the end and make it a triumphal success**.

What to do when stuck because of bug or error

> Involuntarily **I then turn to other work** and am surprised at the freshness of the mind and ease with which I overcome obstacles that had baffled me before. After weeks or months **my passion for the temporarily abandoned invention returns** and **I invariably find answers to all the vexing questions** with scarcely any effort.

At the tip of fingers

> I was fully alive to everything touching on the subject of my research. I could **recall the smallest details and the least significant observations in my experiments** and even recite pages of text and complex mathematical formulae.

Rewards and results

> My belief is firm in a law of compensation. The **true rewards are ever in proportion to the labor and sacrifices made**. This is one of the reasons **why I feel certain that of all my inventions**, the Magnifying Transmitter will prove most important and valuable to future generations. I am prompted to this prediction **not so much by thoughts of the commercial** and industrial revolution which it will surely bring about, **but of the humanitarian consequences** of the many achievements it makes possible.

What will benefit the most

> The greatest good will comes from technical improvements tending to **unification and harmony**, and my wireless transmitter is preeminently such.

Healthy competition

> But universal evidence unmistakably shows that the best results are always obtained in **healthful commercial competition**.

Wireless and its future

> however, exceptional reasons why wireless should be given the fullest freedom of development. In the first place it offers **prospects immeasurably greater and more vital to betterment of human life** than any other invention or discovery in the history of man.

Thoughts on war and what will bring peace

> War can not be avoided until the physical cause for its recurrence is removed and this, in the last analysis, is the vast extent of the planet on which we live. Only thru annihilation of distance in every respect, as the conveyance of intelligence, transport of passengers and **supplies and transmission of energy will conditions be brought about some day, insuring permanency of friendly relations**.

Basis of thought and compulsion

> I have dwelt on the circumstances of my early life and told of **an affliction which compelled me to unremitting exercise of imagination and self observation**. This mental activity, at first involuntary under the pressure of illness and suffering, gradually became second nature and led me finally to recognize that I was but an automaton devoid of free will in thought and action and merely responsive to the forces of the environment.

Cause of wrong ideas

> **Deficient observation** is merely a form of ignorance and responsible for the many morbid notions and foolish ideas prevailing.
