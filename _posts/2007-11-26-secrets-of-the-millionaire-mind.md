so getting a huge sum of money the next day will make us rich?

> The vast majority of people simply do not have the internal capacity to create and hold on to large amounts of money and the increased challenge that go with more money and success. That, my friends, is the primary reason they don't have money. A perfect example is **lottery winners**. Research has shown again and again that regardless of size of their winnings, most lottery winners eventually return to their original financial state, the amount they can comfortably live with. On the other hand, the opposite occurs for self-made millionaires. Notice that when **self-made millionaires** lose their money, they usually have it back within a relatively short period of time.

> Some people like crazy because 'you could easily loose all your money, so you might as well enjoy while you can.' Others go the opposite route: they hoard their money and 'save for a **rainy day**.' A word of wisdom: Saving for a rainy day might sound like a good idea, but it can create big problems. One of the principles we teach in another of our courses is the power of intention. If you are saving money for a rainy day, what are you going to get? Rainy days! Stop doing that!

Wealth principle...

- Your income can grow only to the extent you do!
- If you want to change the fruits, you have to change the roots. If you want to change the visible, you have to change what's invisible.
- give me 5 minutes and I can predict your financial future for the rest of your life
- thoughts -> feelings -> actions -> results
- when the subconscious mind must choose between deeply rooted emotions and logic, emotions will almost always win
- if you motivation for acquiring money or success comes form a nonsupportive root such as fear, anger or the need to 'prove' yourself, your money will never bring you happiness.
