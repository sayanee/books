the white knight myth...

> while i was busy bathing myself in fairy dust and listening to my Prince Charming croon his words of love, I missed out on nurturing my soul. I also lost some self-esteem and the opportunity to grow because i didn't accept responsibility for a major part of my life. The woman who is totally dependant on a man when it comes to money, and ignorant of her financial life, is compromising true love and paralysing herself in the process.

When this positive approach, you'll free up yourself from the grip of **consumerism** and take charge of your financial life.
