Brussels..

> An elegant Upper city and an engaging Lower City: central Brussels is characterized by the contract between the two. Both uptown and downtown districts are best explored on foot, with the Upper city a short stroll from the lower city. The villae basse (Lower city) encircles the medieval heart of Brussels, entwined around the Grand-Place and the port.
