- **My Comments**: My first reading on Feng Shui... very interesting take on objects and surroundings and how they affect the _chi (energy)_ around us.
- **Some extracts**:

Killing cycle of the elements:

- wood kills earth
- earth kills water
- water kills fire
- fire kills metal
- metal kills wood

hostile images bring misfortune energy...

> Having sad or hostile images on the walls of your home or office can bring misfortune. ... These emanate hostile chi very quickly.

Staircases should not start or end directly facing the following features or rooms:

- door
- toilet
- mirror
- bedroom

Keeping the energy of rooms dynamic from year to year

> ... it is exceedingly good luck to welcome in a new piece of furniture or a large enhancement... ... anything that is noticeable and affects the chi energy of the room. ... The introduction of one new signature piece should be accompanied by the removal of another piece. ... ...  In this way the energy of the room rejuvenates from year to year.

Rearrange your decor at frequent intervals...

> This encourages chi energy to move, preventing it from stagnating ... rearranging furniture is particularly beneficial because it re-channels the patterns of chi energy, reflecting its dynamic nature and attracting new cosmic energy into your home.

keep a picture of a beautiful YOU on your dressing table...

> In time you will find your own self-image becomes even more positive than the vision of yourself on your dressing table. This is because you are working on both your physical appearance and inner spiritual strength.
