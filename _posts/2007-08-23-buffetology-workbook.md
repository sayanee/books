- **My Comments**: An excellent book!! I’m gonna buy this... in fact I read it twice in the same week. I have been reading about stocks and such, but never before did I realize the much importance of knowing about companies and their financial situations, their products, mergers, board of directors in order to play well in the stock market. There was plenty of maths as well… I couldn’t really grasp them the first time. Need to read this book once more. Brilliant book!

1. Part 1: Understanding Value investing

2. Part 2: Warren Buffett's intrinsic Value Equations

Introduction…

- Warren is not interested in popular investments such as Internet Companies
- Warren discovered that vast majority of stock market investors are short-term oriented, that they buy on good news and sell on bad
- The short-term stock market mentality sometimes grossly undervalues the long-term prospects of a great business.
- Warren likes to buy on bad news

Identifying the economic engine Warren wants to own

- Warren has separated the world of business into 2 different categories: the healthy consumer monopoly type business and the sick commodity type business
- A consumer monopoly is a type of business that sells a brand name product or has a unique position that allows it to act like a monopoly.
- A commodity type business is the kind that manufactures a generic product or service that a lot of companies produce and sell

Commodity type business has the following characteristics:

- Low Profit margins on sales coupled with low inventory turnover
- Low returns on shareholder’s equity
- Absence of any brand loyalty
- Presence of multiple producers
- Existence of substantial excess production capacity in the industry
- Profitability that is almost entirely dependant upon management’s anilities to efficiently utilize tangible assets

Consumer Monopoly…

- A consumer monopoly is a type of toll business. If you want to buy a certain product you have to purchase it from that one company and no one else.
- Warren’s test for a consumer monopoly is to ask himself whether it would be possible to create a competing business even if one didn’t care about losing money.
- A consumer monopoly sells a product where quality and uniqueness are the most important factors in the consumer’s decisions to buy
- Consumer monopolies, though excellent business, are still subject to the ups and downs of the business cycle and the occasional business calamity

Can you identify if the business has a consumer monopoly?


1. Can you identify a consumer monopoly type product or service that the company sells?

2. Do Historical earnings show a strong and upward trend?

3. Is the company loaded with debt?

4. Does the company earn a high rate of return on shareholder’s equity?

5. Does the company have to spend a high percentage of its retained earnings to maintain its current operations?

6. Are retained earnings free to be invested in new businesses or used to repurchase the company’s shares?

7. Is the company free to adjust process for inflation?

8. Will the value added by retaining earnings lead to an increase in the stock market value of the company?

There are basically 4 types of consumer monopolies…


1. businesses that make products that wear out fast or are used up quickly, that have brand name appeal, and that merchants have to carry or use to stay in businesses

2. communications businesses that provide a repetitive service that manufactures must use to persuade the public to buy their products

3. businesses that provide repetitive consumer services that people and business are consistently in need of

4. Retail stores that have acquired a quasi-monopoly position selling such items as jewelry and furniture

Bad news that creates a buying situation…


1. Stock Market corrections and Panics

2. Industry Recessions

3. Individual Calamities

4. Structural Changes

Share repurchases…

- through the use of share repurchases it is possible for a company to cause an increase in per share earnings while increasing the ownership interests of the remaining shareholders
- share repurchases leave the pie the same size while increasing the size of the slice
- share repurchases make economic sense even at really high share prices
- through the use of share repurchases it is possible for a company to cause an increase in per share earnings while actual net earnings remain the same
- with share repurchases it is also possible for a company to enhance the economic performance of the company
- share repurchases cans sometimes mask poor performance

The Grahamian Equation

- G=the expected gain in the event of success
- L=the expected loss in the event of failure
- C=the expected chance of success, expressed as percentage
- Y=the expected time of holding in years
- P=the current price of the security Applied    CG – L(100% - C)
