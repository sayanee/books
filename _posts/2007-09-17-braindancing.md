most of the greatest developments in our lives emerged from the minds of people who were not specialists in those disciplines...

When in a state on creative mental block, look to the nature for inspiration ...

- da Vince was truly prolific ion observing nature. Studying natural life in minute detail, he then transformed his observations into a deluge of inventions, real and virtual
- human eye provided the inspiration for the modern automatic focus and exposure cameras
- military for the idea of camouflage from creatures in the wild who used this scheme as an act of concealment from predators
- fish's swim bladder inspired the design of the submarine's usage of the underwater ballast

and lastly... an astonishing account of time... in our lifetime on average we spend

- 5 years standing in line
- one year looking for misplaced objects
- 8 months opening direct mails
- 2 years returning calls
- 25 years sleeping
- 6 years sleeping
- 4 years doing chores
