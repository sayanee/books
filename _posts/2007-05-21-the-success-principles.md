The life purpose exercise:

1. List 2 of your unique qualities
2. List 1/2 ways you enjoy expressing those qualities when interacting with others
3. Assume the world is perfect now. What does this world look like?
4. Combine the 3 prior subdivisions of this paragraph into a single statement

Don't live someone else's dreams... (this is so true..) > As a result, we now do a lot of things we don't want to do but that please a lot of other people:

- We go to medical school coz dad wanted it
- we get married to please our mom
- we get a 'real job' instead of pursuing our dream career in arts
- we go straight to grad school instead of taking a backpacking trip to Europe

Don't assume you need a college degree...

> Here;s another statistic showing that believe in yourself is more important than knowledge, training or schooling: 20% of the America's millionaires never set foot in college, and 21 out of 222 American Billionaires never got college diplomas. So although education and a commitment to lifelong learning are essential to success, a formal degree is not a requirement. This is true even in the high-tech world of the internet. Larry Ellison, CEO of Oracle dropped out of University of Illinois ... ... ... Bill Grates dropped out of Havard and later founded Microsoft. ... Vice President Dick Cheney dropped out of college.

Dr. Daniel Amen's 18/40/60 rule:

> When you're 18, you worry about what everybody is thinking of you; when you are 40 you don't give a darn about what anybody thinks of u and when you're 60, you realise nobody's been thinking of you at all! Surprise Surprise!! Most of the time, nobody's thinking about you at all! They are too busy worrying about their own lives, and if they are thinking about you at all, they are wondering what you are thinking about them.

on becoming....

> Money, cars, houses, boats, attractive spouses, power and fame can all be taken away - sometimes in the blink of an eye. But what can never be taken away is who you have become in the process of achieving your goal. TO achieve a big goal, you are going to have to become a bigger person. You are going to have to develop new skills, new attitudes and new capabilities. You are going to have to stretch yourself, and in doing so, you will be stretched forever.
