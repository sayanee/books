I can fall back on a few simple steps when I find myself being overshadowed by anything:

1. I say to myself, :This situation may be shaking me, but I am more than any situation.”
2. I take a deep breath and focus my attention on whatever ny body is feeling
3. I step back and see myself as another person would see me
4. I realize that my emotions are not reliable or reacting to
5. I realize that my emotions are not guides to what is permanent and real
6. If I am about to burst out with uncontrollable reactions I walk away

Causes of suffering:

- overlooking actual facts
- adopting a negative perception
- reinforcing that perception by obsessive thinking
- getting lost in the pain without looking for a way out
- comparing yourself to others
- cementing the suffering through relationships

How to choose without getting trapped:

1. Make the most of every experience
2. don’t obsess over right and wrong decisions
3. stop defending your slef-image
4. GO beyond risks
5. make no decision when in doubt
6. see the possibilities in whatever happens
7. find the stream of joy

Universal principles:

1. the events in my life reflect who I am
2. the people in my life reflect aspects of myself
3. whatever I pay attention to will grow
4. nothing is random
5. at any given moment, the universe is giving me the best results possible
6. my inner awareness is always evolving
7. the direction of life is from duality to unity
8. If I open myself to the force of evolution of evolution, it will carry me where I want to go
9. The fragmented mind cannot get me to unity, but I have to use it along the way
10. I am living in many dimensions at once; the appearance of bring trapped in time and space is just an illusion

some questions…

- Who am I? You are the totality of the universe acting through a human nervous system
- Where did I come from? You came from a source that was never born and will never die
- Why am I here? To create the world in every moment
