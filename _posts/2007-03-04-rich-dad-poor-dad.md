Must read it if you wanna know how we are actually caught up in the rat race! It basically talks about the mentality of a rich dad (Kiyosaki's friend's dad) and a poor dad (Kiyosaki's dad) and what they each teach their kids and how are they different.

but, there are opposing views about the advice given in this book. Read them [here](http://www.slate.com/?id=2067175) and [there](http://www.johntreed.com/Kiyosaki.html). 

And here are some of my learning points from this book...

1. Income
2. Expense
3. Liability
4. Asset

**The Financial IQ is made up of:**

1. Accounting
2. Investing
3. Understanding markets
4. the law- tax advantages + protection from lawsuits

**10 step process to develop god given powers:**

5. Pay yourself first
