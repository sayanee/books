- **My Comments:** Interesting outlook! So say in a discussion, we can always steer the thinking towards a particular direction - instead of saying _you_ need to think differently, we can say let's put on the _yellow_ hat! i'll definitely remember this in group work times! A must read for all meeting coordinators and team leader... or just anybody!!

use of the 'hat' symbolism...

> In practise the hats are always referred to by their colour and never by their function. There is a good reason for this. If you ask someone to give his or her emotional reaction to something, you are unlikely to get an honest answer because people think it is wrong to be emotional. But the term red hat is natural. You can ask someone to "take off the black hat" for a moment.... ... The neutrality of the colours allows the hats to be used without embarrassment. Thinking becomes a game with defined rules rather than a matter of exhortation and condemnation.
