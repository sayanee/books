> Toddlers thrive in an environment that challenges them; they seek to be understood, and they take in the world around them like sponges.



> Toddlers live in the present moment. Walking down the street with a toddler can be a delight.



> Toddlers pick things up effortlessly. Dr. Montessori observed that children under 6 years old take in everything without effort, just as a sponge soaks up water. She referred to this as the absorbent mind.



> Toddlers are enormously capable. Often it is not until we have our own child that we realize how enormously capable they are from such a young age.



> Toddlers are innocent. I don’t think any toddler has a mean bone in their body.



> But they are not mean-spirited, spiteful, or vengeful. They are simply impulsive, following their every urge.



> Toddlers do not hold grudges. Picture a toddler who wants to stay at the park when it’s time to leave.



> Toddlers are authentic.



> When I refer to toddlers, I’m talking about children from around 1 to 3 years old.



> Toddlers need to say “no.” One of the most important developmental phases a toddler passes through is the “crisis of self-affirmation.” Between 18 months and 3 years, children realize that their identity is separate from their parents’ and they begin to desire more autonomy.



> Toddlers need to move. Just as an animal does not like to be caged, our toddlers will not sit still for long. They want to keep mastering movement. Once standing, they move on to climbing and walking.



> Toddlers need to explore and discover the world around them. The Montessori approach recommends that we accept this, set up our spaces for our child to safely explore, get them involved in daily life activities that involve all their senses, and allow them to explore the outdoors.



> Toddlers need freedom. This freedom will help them grow to be curious learners, to experience things for themselves, to make discoveries, and to feel they have control over themselves.



> Toddlers need limits. These limits will keep them safe, teach them to respect others and their environment, and help them become responsible human beings.



> Toddlers need order and consistency. Toddlers prefer things to be exactly the same every day—the same routine, things in the same place, and the same rules. It helps them understand, make sense of their world, and know what to expect.



> When limits are not consistent, toddlers will keep testing them to see what we decide today. If they find it works to nag or melt down, they will try again. This is called intermittent reinforcement.



> Toddlers are not giving us a hard time. They are having a hard time. I love this idea (attributed to educator Jean Rosenberg in the New York Times article “Seeing Tantrums as Distress, Not Defiance”). When we realize their difficult behavior is actually a cry for help, we can ask ourselves, How can I be of help right now? We move from feeling attacked to searching for a way to be supportive.



> Toddlers are impulsive. Their prefrontal cortex (the part of the brain that houses our self-control and decision-making centers) is still developing (and will be for another twenty years).



> Toddlers need time to process what we are saying. Instead of repeatedly telling our child to put on their shoes, we can count to ten in our head to allow them time to process our request. Often, by the time we get to eight, we’ll see them start to respond.



> Toddlers need to communicate. Our children try to communicate with us in many ways.



> Toddlers love mastery. Toddlers love to repeat skills until they master them. Observe them and notice what they are working to master.



> Toddlers like to contribute and be part of the family. They seem to be more interested in the objects their parents use than they are in their toys. They really like to work alongside us as we prepare food, do the laundry, get ready for visitors, and the like.



> It’s about encouraging a child’s curiosity, learning to really see and accept a child as they are, without judgment, and remaining connected with the child, even when we need to stop them from doing something they really want to do.



> In a Montessori approach, we see the child as their own person on their own unique path. We support them as their guide and gentle leader.



> As a gardener, we plant seeds, provide the right conditions, and give enough food, water, and light. We observe the seeds and adjust our care if needed. And we let them grow. This is how we can parent our children, too.



> Dr. Maria Montessori was one of the first female doctors in Italy in the late 1800s. She worked at a clinic in Rome, tending to the poor and their children.



> She immersed herself in educational philosophy, psychology, and anthropology, experimenting with and refining educational materials for these children.



> Larry Page and Sergey Brin (founders of Google), Jeff Bezos (founder of Amazon), Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis (former first lady), and Gabriel García Márquez (Nobel Prize–winning novelist) all attended Montessori schools.



> top-down approach.



> one-size-fits-all approach.



> In Montessori education there is a dynamic relationship between the child, the adult, and the learning environment. The child is in charge of their own learning, supported by the adult and the environment.



> Dr. Montessori reiterates that the objective of Montessori education is not to fill a child with facts, but to cultivate their own natural desire to learn.



> I make sure the children have the tools they need to succeed—I



> I sit on the floor to see what it looks like from their height. I



> I prepare the space so it is simple and beautiful. I remove any clutter, I set out a few, well-chosen activities, and I make sure that activities are complete and not missing any parts so the children can work with them independently.



> The discoveries children make for themselves—particularly within a prepared environment—build wonder in the child and a love of learning. They do not need to be directed to explore the environment.



> When a child shows a particular interest in one area—for example, movement, language, math, reading—it is known as a sensitive period. This describes a moment when the child is particularly attuned to learning a certain skill or concept and it happens with ease and without effort.



> If a toddler is interested in climbing on the table, they are likely in a sensitive period for movement and need to practice those skills. Instead of allowing them to climb on furniture, we can create an obstacle course with pillows, blankets, things to balance on, and things to climb.



> From birth until about the age of 6, children take in information effortlessly. Dr. Montessori referred to this as the absorbent mind. From birth to the age of 3, they do this completely unconsciously.



> They can even pick up our feelings and attitudes, for example, when we drop something and get frustrated with ourselves (as opposed to forgiving ourselves) or if we have a fixed mind-set that we are bad at drawing (as opposed to a growth mind-set where we might show that we can always keep improving our skills).



> At school or at home, we can have a few rules for children to live by to learn respect and responsibility for themselves, others, and the environment around them. Within these limits, children have freedom of choice, of movement, and of will.



> Children want to be able to do more, to contribute, to be a part of the family/classroom/society. We see satisfaction on their face when they pull on their own shoe, put something back where it belongs, or help a friend.



> Through independence the child learns how to be responsible for caring for themselves, others, and the environment.



> A Montessori teacher will have such respect for the child that they will treat them the same way they would an adult. We can see this in the way they speak to the child, the way they ask permission if they need to touch them



> Montessori activities for toddlers fall into five main areas: 1. eye-hand coordination 2. music and movement 3. practical life (activities of daily life) 4. arts and crafts 5. language



> Montessori activities usually target one skill. For example, putting a ball into a box through a small hole allows the child to master this one skill. This differs from many traditional plastic toys that target multiple skills at the same time, with one part for pushing, one part where a ball drops, another part that makes a noise, and so on.



> We also prefer to use natural materials. Toddlers explore with all their senses. Natural materials like wood are lovely to touch and generally safe for putting in their mouths, and the weight of the object is more likely to be directly related to its size.



> Many Montessori activities have a beginning, middle, and end. The child may begin with a small part of the sequence and, as they develop, will be able to complete the full work cycle, including replacing the activity on the shelf.



> Montessori activities are complete. Completing an activity is important for their sense of mastery.



> Activities are often organized in individual trays and baskets. Within each tray or basket is everything the child needs to complete the task by themselves.



> Children gain mastery of an activity through repetition. The activity should be exactly at their level—challenging enough that it is not too easy yet not so difficult that they give up.



> A child has the freedom to choose an activity.



> Let the child lead Follow the child’s pace and interests.



> 2. Let them work with the activity as long as they like



> 3. Avoid quizzing the child We may not realize we are doing it, but we are constantly quizzing our children.



> Now I see that this prompting is a kind of test for a child. And there is generally only one correct answer, so if the answer they give is wrong, we have no other option than to say, “No, that flower is yellow, not blue.” Not exactly great for building a child’s confidence.



> Instead we can continue to name things, ask questions to arouse curiosity, and use observation to see what the child has mastered and what they are still practicing.



> Now, the only time I will quiz a child is if I am 100 percent sure they know the answer and will be excited to tell me.



> 4. Put the activity away when finished



> When the child is finished with an activity, we can encourage them to return it to its place on the shelf. This routine emphasizes that there is a beginning, middle, and end to a task.



> 5. Model, model, model



> 6. Allow any use of the materials, but stop when they’re used inappropriately



> 7. Modify to meet their level



> 8. Arrange the activities on shelves from easiest to hardest



> 9. Use what is available



> 10. Be careful with small parts and sharp objects



> How to set up an activity



> 1. Display it on a shelf.



> 2.  Make it attractive. Putting an activity into a basket or tray can make it more appealing to a child.



> 3. Show what belongs together. A tray or basket keeps all the necessary items together.



> 4. Prepare everything so our child can help themselves.



> 5.  Undo the activity. A completed activity is less attractive to a toddler than one that has been left undone. Disassemble the activity before returning it to the shelf.



> Threading allows our child to refine their grasp, eye-hand coordination, and dexterity, and provides practice working with two hands together.



> Posting activities With posting activities the child learns to release an object into a container and begins to understand object permanence



> Opening and closing activities Another way to work a child’s hands is to provide opportunities for them to open and close various containers.



> Pegboard and elastic bands; nuts and bolts These activities are great ways to refine the child’s fine-motor development.



> Sorting Starting around 18 months, toddlers become interested in sorting objects by color, type, and size.



> Stereognostic bags Around 2.5 years, the child will be interested in figuring out what an object is simply by feeling it.



> Puzzles Babies and young toddlers like pulling apart puzzles. Knob puzzles where the puzzle pieces fit into a designated shape are perfect for this age.



> 02 / Music and movement Music



> Many children move instinctively when music comes on. A family may have traditional or cultural dances that they enjoy performing or watching.



> Movement We can provide many movement opportunities for our children: • running • jumping • skipping • hopping • brachiating (swinging like a monkey) • biking • climbing • sliding • balancing • kicking and throwing balls



> If possible, we can head outdoors for movement in the backyard, nearby forest, playground, town square, beach, mountain, river, or lake—even if the weather is not great. “There is no such thing as bad weather, just bad clothing,” as the Scandinavians like to say.



> 03 / Practical life Activities of daily life around the home



> These activities are great for learning a sequence, like retrieving and putting on an apron all the way through washing and drying the dishes.



> Here are some ways children can help around the home: • Plant care—watering the plants, dusting the leaves, planting seeds, arranging flowers in small vases



> • Food preparation—washing vegetables, beating eggs, scooping their own cereal



> • Snack time—helping themselves to food from an accessible snack area



> • Mealtimes—setting and clearing the table, washing dishes • Baking—taking turns, measuring ingredients, helping to add ingredients, stirring • Cleaning—sweeping, dusting, wiping spills, cleaning windows, polishing mirrors



> • Learning to care for themselves—blowing nose, brushing hair and teeth, washing hands • Dressing themselves—taking socks on and off, fastening Velcro shoes, putting on a T-shirt, pulling trousers up and down,



> Helping with the laundry—bringing dirty clothes to the laundry basket,



> Getting ready for overnight visitors



> Trips to the supermarket—making a list with pictures, getting things from the shelves,



> Volunteer work—It’s never too early to set the example of helping others.



> Focus on the process, not the result. When the child helps, the task will take longer and the result may not look perfect, but the child is learning to master these skills and will become a lifelong helper at home.



> Beyond the simple pleasure young children take from these practical life activities, they are valuable in more ways than one: • The child is learning to take responsibility in the home. • We are working together to create, practice, and master the activities. • Collaboration creates connection. • These skills require repetition to gain mastery, which is great for building concentration. • Our child enjoys feeling like a part of the family and being able to contribute.



> • These activities involve sequences.



> • These activities involve a lot of movement, great for refining fine-motor and gross-motor skills



> • There are many language opportunities around these activities:



> For toddlers, arts and crafts activities are about self-expression, movement, and experiencing different materials. The process takes precedence over the product.



> I like to start with one or two colors at first. If we add more colors, everything tends to turn brown.



> We can introduce using scissors (with supervision) from around 18 months. For the cutting work, use real scissors with rounded ends that cut well, and show the child how to use them appropriately.



> Around 18 months, a gluing activity can be great fun and help them refine their movements



> 1. Try not to be prescriptive. Rather than showing a child what to make with the art materials, we show them how to use the materials and leave the experimentation up to them.



> 2. Give feedback. In Montessori, rather than tell the child their artwork is “good” we like to leave it up to the child to decide if they like what they have made.



> 3. Use good-quality materials. I always recommend quality over quantity, which is particularly important when working with art materials.



> 4. Show by example. When showing our child how to use art materials, it is often better to draw squiggles or loose lines than draw a picture.



> The best example of all is to hang beautiful artwork from artists on the walls of our home and at child height, too, for the whole family to appreciate.



> To help toddlers grow their desire to learn words, we can put together vocabulary baskets for them to explore. These baskets have objects classified by theme: items from the kitchen; Australian animals; tools; or musical instruments.



> real objects that the child can touch, feel, and explore as we name them,



> replica objects. Because we can’t have real elephants in our classrooms or homes,



> We can make matching identical cards with pictures of the objects



> The Montessori philosophy is to wait until they are over 6 years old to introduce fantasy (especially scary fantasy), when they begin to understand the difference between reality and fantasy.



> What to look for in books: • Realistic pictures.



> Beautiful images.



> Number of words.



> Different types of pages. Start with board books; move on to paper pages as the child learns how to handle books.



> Books we enjoy.



> Books that reflect diversity. Find books that reflect families, races, nationalities, and belief systems that are different from our own.



> Dr. Montessori had such a holistic idea of children and their development, including the importance of the outdoors and nature. Nature has the ability to calm us, to connect us with beauty, and to reconnect us to the earth and environment.



> Montessori activities outdoors and in nature:  1. Seasonal activities.



> collect leaves, acorns, shells, sticks, rocks, stones, and pinecones. Fruit picking varies by season, too.



> 2. Grow vegetables. It isn’t necessary to have a garden to grow vegetables at home.



> 3. Movement opportunities. Climb trees; balance along walls, tree stumps, or logs; hang from branches;



> 4. Notice the beauty of the outdoors together.



> 5. Find moments of quiet. Find a place to sit and watch the clouds, to sit in silence, or just to breathe.



> 6. Make treasure hunts. Make a list of pictures and work together to find all the items on the list. It



> 7.  Build a hut, cubby house, or obstacle course, and invite over some friends.  8. Make outdoor art. Use mud, water, leaves, flowers, soil, seeds, grass,



> 9. Make a musical wall.



> 10. All-weather exploration. There is no such thing as bad weather, just bad clothing. So



> If a child starts attending a Montessori preschool program, I’d advise against replicating the Montessori materials at home so that they will stay engaged at school. Instead we can continue Montessori at home by including the child in daily life and making sure they have time for unstructured play, opportunities to create, time outdoors, and time for rest.



> We aren’t aiming to have a perfect home, but we can be intentional in setting up our spaces.



> Eight tips for setting up your home 1.  Child-sized.



> 2.  Beauty in the space.



> 3.  Independence. Have activities and materials set up in trays and baskets so they have everything they need at the ready;



> 4.  Attractive activities. Have age-appropriate activities beautifully arranged on shelves—rather than in toy boxes—that



> 5.  Less is more. Displaying only a few activities helps the child’s concentration; display only the ones they are working to master,



> 6.  A place for everything and everything in its place. Toddlers have a particularly strong sense of order. When we have a place for everything and everything is in its place,



> 7.  See the space through their eyes. Get down to the child’s height in each space to see what it looks like from their perspective.



> 8.  Store and rotate. Create storage that ideally is out of children’s sight and easy on the eye—think floor-to-ceiling cupboards that blend into the wall color, an attic space, or containers that can be stacked in a storage area or behind a couch.



> Adapt them to suit. Limitations of space or light give us opportunities to be creative.



> Entrance



> Living room



> Kitchen • Low shelf, cupboard, trolley, or drawer with a small number of child-sized plates,



> Use real glasses, plates, and cutlery—children will learn to carry these items with care if they are aware that the items may break. We can remind them that glass is fragile and to use two hands



> Stepladder or learning tower or kitchen helper so the child can reach the kitchen counter to help (alternatively,



> Child-sized cleaning materials - broom, mop, small dustpan, and brush



> sponges cut to fit their hands



> Note about safety: Keep sharp knives out of reach and show the child how to use them when they are ready; be available to supervise.



> Eating area



> Bedroom



> If space allows, a small shelf with a few activities for them to quietly play with when they wake



> Ensure the room is completely childproof—cover electrical sockets, remove any loose wires, put curtain cords



> out of reach, and install child locks on windows.



> A changing area. Once they are standing, children wearing diapers often don’t like to be laid down to be changed. Instead, we can change them standing up in the bathroom to introduce them to the idea that this is where they will use the toilet.



> Low step to help them to reach the bathroom sink and to climb into the bath



> Arts and crafts area • Access to art materials—for example, a small set of drawers with pencils, paper, glue, stamps, and collage items



> Around 3 years, the child will start to enjoy collecting things they will need. Then we may have a tray they can use to select art materials by themselves from a display.



> Cozy place for reading • Have a forward-facing bookshelf or ledge so the child can easily see the cover of the books. Or use a book basket. • Display only a few books and change the selection as needed.



> Outside • Create opportunities for movement activities: running; jumping; skipping; hopping; brachiating (swinging like a monkey); sliding; dancing; swinging on a rope, an old tire, or a regular swing



> Gardening—small rakes, trowels, garden forks, wheelbarrow



> 1. small table and chair 2. low shelf 3. bookshelf/book box 4. low bed/floor mattress child can get into themselves 5. low stool for reaching sink, toilet, and so on 6. low hooks with cleaning equipment 7. stepladder/learning tower for helping in the kitchen 8. low hooks for coat and bag by the entrance



> General principles to keep in mind Tackling the clutter



> The first step is to reduce the number of toys, books, and arts and crafts materials, and the general mess that accumulates in our homes.



> This box can be stored for now; we can rotate and reintroduce these activities when our child needs a new challenge.



> This will be an ongoing process that will eventually include our child, developing ideas about reusing, recycling, charity, and taking care of our toys with the idea that they can be passed along when we are ready for something new.



> Arrange things so children can manage more independently and successfully. Have things they need at their height, so that they’re easily accessible. Remove items that are not suitable for them to touch. Keep adjusting and improving, particularly as the child grows.



> Remember, we want our homes to be “yes” spaces that are safe for our toddlers to explore. When we find ourselves saying “no”—for example, when our child is touching something dangerous or banging on glass—we can look for ways to set up the space to remove the temptation.



> We can cover an electrical outlet that is proving tempting, move furniture to block places we don’t want them to explore, use child safety locks on a cupboard we don’t want opened, or put a fragile glass cabinet into storage until our child is a little older.



> Sharing spaces If we have more than one child, here are some extra things to consider: • Set up spaces for different ages - Use lower shelves for activities for the younger child or for any age; use higher shelves for activities with smaller parts more suitable for the older children.



> Store small parts in containers that are difficult for younger children to open. - Establish a place or two where each child can go to be by themselves.



> Provide privacy if needed, perhaps using a curtain to divide the room.



> Here are some ideas to help: • Use bunk beds/high beds, or store beds away during the day



> Keep fewer things on display at a time to keep the space from feeling cluttered.



> Use space on the walls (such as pegboards to hang craft materials) or underused spaces for storage (under beds, for example), or disguise cabinets for storage near the ceiling (perhaps by painting them the same color as the wall).



> Encouraging the child to take part in daily life • Aiding their independence • Providing peaceful, nurturing, and creative spaces for the whole family



> Helping build the child’s concentration with less clutter and fewer, more focused activities • Allowing the child to absorb and appreciate beauty • Beginning to show them how to be responsible for their things • Helping them absorb the culture(s) in which they live



> SELF-CARE AREA



> This small self-care area is simple and attractive. Here the child can blow their nose, wipe their face, or brush their hair.



> This arts and crafts area is set up for an older toddler. The open shelves are inviting and accessible, and the use of trays and containers makes it easy to see what is available.



> KITCHEN



> A low drawer in the kitchen allows the child to help themselves to food preparation tools.



> Five ingredients for curiosity



> 1. Trust in the child Dr. Montessori encourages us to trust that the child wants to learn and grow—and that the child intrinsically knows what they need to be working on to develop as they should.



> 2. A rich learning environment



> 3. Time For children to develop and follow their urge to discover, explore, and wonder, they need time. Time that is unscheduled. Time that is not rushed. Even times when they feel bored. Allow time to explore. Allow time for movement. Allow time for language and conversation. Allow time for building connections. Allow time for wonder and curiosity. Whether



> A safe and secure base As a parent we can provide physical and emotional safety and security. We keep our child physically safe from electrical outlets, busy roads, and other dangers. We childproof our homes, or at least one area of it, so that our child can freely explore.



> 5. Fostering a sense of wonder We can ask our child questions about the world we see, invite them to explore with all their senses, and get out into nature as often as possible.



> Seven principles for curious humans



> 1. Follow the child—let them lead. 2. Encourage hands-on learning—let them explore. 3. Include the child in daily life—let them be included. 4. Go slow—let them set their own pace. 5. Help me to help myself—let them be independent and responsible. 6. Encourage creativity—let them wonder. 7. Observe—let them show us.



> let the child lead, to not interrupt when the child is focusing deeply on something (as much as possible, at least), and to follow their interests.



> But it is not being directive either. When we hear ourselves giving commands, giving lessons, or giving too much information, may we remember, Ah, yes. How can I find a way to step back and let them lead?



> 2. Encourage hands-on learning Toddlers learn best when they touch things, smell things, hear things, taste things, and see things. To raise curious learners, look for ways to provide hands-on, firsthand experiences for them.



> When they start to ask questions, instead of simply giving them the answer, we can say, “I don’t know. Let’s find out together.”



> Our toddlers are learning that if they don’t know something, they can be resourceful and find it out, often in a hands-on, concrete way.



> 3. Include the child in daily life Toddlers are curious about what we are up to. They want to be a significant member of the family. They are not just trying to drive us crazy by clinging to our leg.



> We can invite them by saying, “We are getting dinner ready. Which part would you like to do?” They



> Having young children involved does mean that it’s messier and slower. But we are making connections and memories that will last a lifetime. Those of us struggling with fitting this into our days and weeks with work and life commitments can start with moments when we do have time.



> Recognize that on weekdays, we may not have the time or patience to let our children help cook, but they can be involved in setting the table, pouring their own drink at dinner, and taking their plate to the counter after the meal.



> 4. Go slow



> With toddlers, the “tempo giusto” will often be a lot slower than we are used to. Toddlers do not like to rush



> Going slowly gives our child time to explore and be curious. And we would do well to learn from them. They remind us to slow down and be present.



> Help me to help myself “Help me to help myself” is an expression often used in Montessori. It means: • setting up things for our child to be successful by themselves • stepping in as little as possible and as much as is necessary,



> Break the task into small steps and show them very slowly. Toddlers will pick it up faster if we don’t talk at the same time we’re showing them.



> We scaffold skills as the child gains competence and maturity. The skills will become more difficult or have more steps or require them to follow multistep instructions.



> Allow time



> These daily activities can provide moments of connection and opportunities for learning, when our child learns to do things for themselves and becomes confident in their own abilities.



> Be friendly about mistakes



> Instead of punishing, lecturing, or correcting them, try this: 1.  If they get the name of something wrong, we can make a mental note that they don’t know it yet. We can teach it again at another (neutral) time.



> In Montessori we have a phrase for this: “Teach by teaching, not by correcting.” 2.  If they break or spill things, we can have supplies at the ready for them to help clean it up. 3.  We can support them while they make it up to someone they have hurt. 4.  We can model not taking ourselves too seriously when we make mistakes and show them that we apologize.



> Offering help Rather than rushing in to help our toddler, we wait to see how much they can manage themselves.



> 6. Encourage creativity



> Reasons cited include the fact that Montessori materials are for a specific purpose rather than being more open-ended, that we do not have a pretend-play corner in our classrooms, and that we do not encourage fantasy in children under 6 years old (rather, we focus on the concrete world around them). Imagination



> The 3-year-olds had difficulty distinguishing real from fantastical scenes.



> Around 2.5+ years, we will see our child begin with pretend play. This is a sign that they are processing what they see around them (imagination). They play families, bake us cookies, and pretend to be the schoolteacher.



> The focus on reality won’t limit their creativity; it will enhance it. We can see the groundwork flourish in adolescence when the imagination becomes particularly strong and they start to come up with creative solutions to our world problems and for social change.



> We can: • Invite open-ended use of materials (use fewer art kits and coloring books, which are more prescriptive). • Prepare ourselves to encourage creativity—allow time and be open to allowing mess and exploration; prepare a space that is okay to get dirty; relax, join in, and create together.



> Allow boredom. When we have unscheduled time in our day to sit without anything planned (and without technology to entertain us), our child has a chance to be bored. Their mind can wander and daydream, they can come up with new ideas, and they can make new connections.



> 7. Observation Often Montessori teachers will tell parents, “Just observe your child.” Observe what about my child? Why? And how?



> Some things we can observe Fine-motor skills



> Gross-motor skills



> Communication



> Cognitive development • What they are interested in • What they are practicing and learning to master, and the activities they can complete • How long they play with an activity Social development



> Emotional development • When the child cries, smiles, and laughs • How they get comforted or comfort themselves



> Eating



> Sleeping



> Independence



> Clothing



> Self-observation



> Toddlers want to feel significant, they want to feel like they belong, and they want to be accepted for who they are. If we understand this, we can move away from doing battle with them or being triggered by them, and move toward being able to guide, support, and lead them.



> And we could translate for our partner or the child’s grandparent if we notice they are getting upset. “It sounds like it is important to your mother/grandfather to sit at the table to eat, and you really want to walk around with your food.”



> As the adult, we often need to act as our toddler’s prefrontal cortex (the rational part of their brain), which is still developing. We can step in to keep them safe. To keep others safe. To keep ourselves safe. To show them they can disagree with others in a respectful way.



> “It’s okay to disagree, but I can’t let you hurt your brother/sister. You sit on this side of me, and you sit on the other.”



> These types of praise are extrinsic motivators that do not come from within the child themselves. Alfie Kohn wrote a useful article, “Five Reasons to Stop Saying ‘Good Job!’” in which he points out that: • Praise can actually be used to manipulate children when we use it as a bargaining tool to motivate them.



> Montessori teachers believe instead that a child will learn to behave if we help to develop their intrinsic motivation—their internal radar that tells them that something is right (or wrong) and recognizes what helps (or hurts) themselves or someone else.



> When looking for alternatives, the best guide is to think about what we would say to another adult when giving them feedback.



> know more specifically what we appreciate and give the child vocabulary that is so much richer than simply “good job.” 1. Describe what we see



> 2. Sum it up with a word



> 3. Describe how we feel



> As the adults in their lives, we need to be careful about labeling our children. We likely have someone in our life who has been labeled “the clown,” “the shy one,” “the naughty one.” Even positive labels can be difficult to always live up to (e.g., “the clever one,” “the athletic one”). These labels can last a lifetime—something the child never grows out of.



> Once a new baby is born into the family, a young child suddenly becomes the “big brother/sister.” It is a huge responsibility to have to behave all the time and show their sibling how to be a “big kid.” Instead of always leaving the eldest in charge, for example, while we are in the bathroom, we can get children to look after each other, regardless of their age.



> Cultivating cooperation in a toddler is a tricky thing. Toddlers are naturally curious, they are impulsive, and they are servants to their will. Common ways of trying to get cooperation from toddlers include threats, bribes, punishment, and constant repetition.



> We find ourselves thinking, Why won’t they listen to me? “If you’ve told a child a thousand times, and the child still has not learned, then it is not the child who is the slow learner.” —Walter B. Barbe



> Threats, bribes, and punishments are extrinsic motivations. The child may cooperate to avoid a punishment or to get a sticker or some ice cream. But that kind of discipline rarely has a long-term effect.



> When we threaten a child with punishment like a time-out, we begin to erode the trust between parent and child. Two things can happen. They can become scared of the adult and cooperate out of fear, or they find a way to do what they want sneakily, without their parent finding out.



> They simply want to avoid the negative consequences (punishment) or take advantage of the positive ones (rewards). Threats and bribes may need to get bigger and more elaborate as the child grows.



> The child is not in charge, but they can have input into how to solve problems. We can ask, “How can we solve the problem?” and then come up with solutions together.



> In addition, the toddler is more likely to take ownership of the planned solution and follow through. It’s also a great skill for solving problems with others.



> One way to solve problems with toddlers is to make a simple checklist with them (especially one with pictures).



> When they are involved in making and using the checklist, they take ownership of the solution.



> Ways to involve our child Give age-appropriate choices



> We can offer our toddler choices to encourage cooperation. Not big decisions like where they will go to school, but age-appropriate choices, like which color T-shirt they would like to wear



> Give them information



> Rather than issuing commands—“Put the orange peel in the bin, please”—we can give information instead: “The orange peel goes in the bin.” Then they can figure out for themselves that they need to take it to the bin. It becomes something they choose to do rather than another order from the adult.



> Use one word



> Sometimes we use too many words to give instructions to our children.



> Try using just one word. “Shoes.”



> At the playground, we could say, “We have five minutes before we leave the playground. What would you like to have one last turn on?”



> And, just like a checklist, it’s the timer that tells them the time is up, not us.



> How we can talk to help them listen Use positive language



> Instead of telling a child what not to do, we can tell them with positive language what they can do instead. Rather than, “No running” (what they should not do), we can say, “We walk inside”



> Speak with a respectful tone and attitude



> A whiny tone, an insecure voice, a strict voice, or a threatening tone can distort the best of intentions and does not show our child we value them and want to work with them.



> Ask them for help



> Say “yes” If we are saying “no” a hundred times a day, our child will gradually begin to ignore it altogether. It is best to reserve “no” for times when their safety is a concern.



> Say a toddler wants another cracker but they haven’t finished their first one. We could say in a gentle tone, “Yes, you can have another cracker . . . when you have finished this one.”



> Sometimes when I’ve been helping a child get dressed and they are resisting, I pretend to put their shoe on my foot. The child laughs and tells me, “No, Simone, it goes on my foot.” And they put it on.



> Humor is particularly useful when we are on the verge of losing our temper. Something as simple as singing a silly song can relieve some tension for us and coax a smile from them. It’s a simple way to start fresh.



> our child is going through a “no” phase, adjust our language



> During the “no” phase, we may want to adjust our language to tell them what is happening, rather than asking them.



> Have age-appropriate expectations and be prepared We cannot expect our toddler to behave in the way we like all of the time. Sitting quietly in a doctor’s waiting room or in a cafe or on a train can be very difficult. Remember that they have a strong will to explore, move, and communicate, and are very impulsive.



> First, we may need to adjust our expectations—we may not get to read a magazine, check our phone, or make a phone call. In a cafe or restaurant, be prepared to take them for a little walk when they start to get agitated or loud, perhaps to see the chef at work or look at the fish tank together.



> Second, be prepared. Don’t forget to pack plenty of water, food, a few favorite books, and a little zippered pouch with a few favorite toys—a couple of small vehicles, a bottle with a coin to drop in, some shells, and so on.



> Allow time for processing It can take a toddler (and older children, too) a while to process what we say.



> Do not underestimate how much a toddler likes having the same rhythm every day.



> It does not have to be on a fixed schedule, but the more regular the routine, the less resistance we will get.



> Write a note Most toddlers can’t read yet, but notes can still be very powerful. We can write a note that says “No climbing” and place it on the table. Then we can point to the note and say, “It says, ‘No climbing.’”



> Notes are very effective, even with prereaders. But use them in moderation. If notes are stuck everywhere, they will definitely lose their effectiveness.

Bonus • Write a note.



> Children, toddlers especially, need order. They need to know what to expect. They need to know that things are consistent and predictable. That their parents will keep them safe and secure.



> It’s a good idea to have a few rules that are important to the family. Too many rules and it will be like a dictatorship. But it’s helpful to have a few simple and clear rules aimed at keeping everyone safe and living more peacefully with others—just



> Examples of ground/house rules • We are kind to each other. This



> We sit at the (dining) table to eat.



> We contribute to the household. No matter what our age, we help around the house, and our help is valued.



> We engage in rough play by mutual consent.



> We may need to revise them as our children grow. Not in the middle of an argument, though. Do it at a neutral (ideally, planned) moment.



> I feel most comfortable setting limits with language like “I can’t let you . . .” or “I’m going to . . .” It’s clear. It takes ownership of our role as the parent.



> Some things I consider dangerous: touching something hot, going near an electrical outlet, running onto the road, getting too far ahead in the street unattended, climbing near a window.



> I have learned from Nonviolent Communication to guess what a child might be feeling rather than simply naming it. • It looks like you . . . • Are you telling me . . . ? • Are you feeling . . . ? • It seems like . . . • I’m guessing you might feel . .



> Let them release the full range of emotions. Allow even ugly feelings. Show them we are able to love them at their worst. Once they are calm, we’ll be able to help them make amends if needed.



> Therefore, all the reasoning in the world or explanations will fall on deaf ears. We need to first help them close the lid by giving them support to calm down. We can offer them a cuddle; we don’t assume that they want one.



> We are saying it’s okay for them to melt down. Rather than trying to get the tantrum to stop as soon as possible, allow them to express all their feelings safely until they are calm, and show that we are there to help if they need us.



> Calm and kind acceptance encourages them to express their feelings. Over time, they will find healthier forms of expression, but they will not be scared to share their feelings with us because they will know that we are capable of being kind and calm even when they have feelings that are big and scary.



> In Positive Discipline: The First Three Years, Jane Nelsen talks about setting up a calm space for an older toddler around 3 years old, a place with some of their favorite things where they can go anytime they need to calm down.



> If they are still young, we can model it for them. “Let’s go and see if our friend is okay.” “I’m sorry my child hurt you. Are you feeling okay?” Modeling is more effective than forcing them to apologize if they don’t mean it, having them mutter “Sorry” under their breath, or having them say it in a sarcastic tone.



> It really helps them when we know our limits. They learn that when we say “no,” we mean “no.” We are reliable, we are trustworthy, and we have their best interests in mind.



> This is what psychologists call intermittent reinforcement. If they get a different response one time, they will keep trying.



> Rather than seeing these daily care activities as something we need to get through quickly, we can see them as moments of connection with our child.



> When we have a place for everything, then everything is (mostly) in its place and easy to find. We are less likely to be frantically searching for a missing glove or shoe.



> Don’t forget that we can also take the time to teach children the skills for getting dressed when we are not in a hurry to leave the house. Toddlers love to be able to do things themselves.



> This is an opportunity to scaffold skills. They will learn how to dress if we break it down into small steps, each one building on the other, and over time will manage more and more of the process themselves.



> If they push us away completely, we can say, “Okay, just let me know if you need any help. I’m right here.”



> If we find it difficult to sit and watch a toddler get dressed at toddler pace, we can find a way to make the process enjoyable, like bringing in a cup of tea or coffee (keep hot drinks out of their reach) or putting on some relaxing or upbeat music.



> Remember that toddlers are in the process of becoming independent from us—some days they will want us to help and sometimes they will want to do it themselves. It’s what I like to call the crisis of independence.



> “You really want to get dressed by yourself, and it is time to leave. I’m going to help you put the last things on.” Know our boundaries and set a limit when needed.



> So it is useful to find a seat that the child can get in and out of independently rather than high chairs with straps and a tray table in front, which keeps them farther from the table and requires our assistance.



> From 12 months, a toddler no longer needs a bottle to drink and can take regular milk in a glass at mealtimes. Start with a small amount in a small glass, filled only as full as we are prepared to clean up.



> Rather than filling up a toddler’s plate (which can feel overwhelming or end up on the floor), we can start with a small amount of food and let them serve themselves more if they would like.



> Leave the child in charge. Trust that they are taking enough. Children at this age generally will not starve themselves. They will take as much as they need if we remove our control around food and trust them to listen to their bodies.



> If our child is not a big eater, we will often observe that their appetite fluctuates. Sometimes they don’t seem to finish anything on their plate, yet during growth spurts, they may eat three meals a day, plus snacks, and still be hungry. Their bodies know exactly what they need.



> A young toddler can also learn to use cutlery to feed themselves. A fork is easier to use than a spoon at the beginning. We can show them how to pierce a piece of food with the fork, and leave it in front of them so they can bring it to their own mouth.



> Throwing food off their plate can be an experiment to see what happens when it falls. Usually they start throwing their food when they have had enough to eat: They are telling us they are all finished. We can ask them, “Are you telling me you are all finished?”



> Around 12 to 16 months, a toddler will generally move to one nap time in the middle of the day and then sleep at night from ten to twelve hours.



> By around 14 months, they could move into a toddler bed with a low side that they are able to climb into independently, or use a floor mattress.



> These children often have clear sleep associations from birth, and consistent bedtime sequences. They go to bed drowsy but awake, do not have sleep crutches, and feed separately from falling asleep.



> A nice, gentle technique to help them fall asleep by themselves is to place a chair by their bed. Once the bedtime sequence is finished, sit in the chair quietly (maybe read a book).



> If they are sick or teething, they may need some additional support from us. These things can disrupt their sleeping pattern, and we will need to reestablish it once they are feeling better. Sleep



> If they fall asleep while being rocked or fed, they will wake up from light sleep during their nap or night sleep and look for the adult, unable to resettle until the same conditions are established. We become their sleep crutch.



> With my second child, we kept a clear daily rhythm from birth. Eat, play, sleep. It was much clearer for us (and her) when it was time to rest.



> If our child detects that we are trying to distract them, they may feel like we are tricking them rather than getting their cooperation and may resist even more. Just as stickers work for a while as a reward, distraction works only up to a point before they tire of that “trick” and you need to work even harder to keep them on task.



> Our children pick up our attitudes toward dirty diapers from infancy, and if we are screwing up our face, they will learn that it is a dirty thing instead of a normal bodily process.



> I’m not including any ages here, but rather, signs that the child may be ready: • pulling at their diaper when it is wet or soiled • squatting or going to a private place while they poop • telling us they have peed or pooped • resisting having their diaper changed (sometimes) • taking off their diaper



> If they don’t make it to the potty/toilet, we can calmly say, “Ah. I see you are wet. We have everything we need right here. Let’s get dry.”



> Next we can help them go to the bathroom to change. Montessori teachers generally say, “You have wet clothes. Let’s go change,” rather than, “You had an accident.”



> Offer the potty/toilet regularly at first.



> Instead, we can wait until they aren’t in the middle of an activity and simply say, “It’s time to go to the potty,” leading them to the bathroom.



> We can move to underpants at nap time and night at the same time or when we notice they can hold for longer periods and wake with a dry diaper/underwear.



> Sometimes a toddler who knows how to use the toilet will suddenly start to pee on the floor intentionally. Observe them. Often they are telling us through their behavior that they are unhappy about something in their world,



> It generally takes a few days for the child to learn to fall asleep without it, during which they may need a little—just enough—extra support. Be careful not to add any new sleeping crutches into the routine.



> We can ask others to help with the newborn for some of the time, so we can have time to be alone with our toddler.



> Some toddlers like to be involved in caring for the new baby—fetching a clean diaper or getting soap for the baby’s bath. Some won’t be interested, and that’s okay, too.



> We can find creative ways to spend regular one-on-one time with our toddler: a trip to the supermarket, a walk down the road to a cafe for a snack, or a visit to the playground for ten minutes on the swing.



> Siblings like to draw us into their disputes to take sides. My favorite advice (which I need to remind myself of at times) is to stay neutral and not take sides in these conflicts.



> Our role is to support both children, keep them safe if needed, and help mediate so that both parties take responsibility. We see things from both perspectives and give them just as much help as they need.



> 1. Be visible



> During minor arguments, we can let them see that we are in the room and then leave again. Think of this as an important experience in conflict resolution. They know that we have seen them arguing, but we are confident they can work it out themselves. 2.



> “So Sara, you want to keep holding the puppy. And you, Billy, want to have a turn too.” (Reflect each child’s point of view.) “That’s a tough one: two children and one puppy.” (Describe the problem.) “I have confidence that you two can work out a solution that’s fair to each of you . . . and fair to the puppy.”



> Generally, the more we foster positive interactions between our children, the closer they become.



> At neutral times, we can discuss the positive side of having siblings or ask our children what they like about having a sibling.



> Instead of asking the child to share their activity with someone else, in Montessori schools the ground rule is that we share by taking turns. We have only one of each activity; a child can work as long as they like with it (to allow repetition, concentration, and mastery); and children learn to wait their turn, a useful skill.



> To our child, we could say, “I see another child is waiting to use the swing. Let’s count to ten and then we’ll give them a turn.” Rather than staying with the activity until our child is completely finished, we are modeling grace and courtesy toward others.



> When visitors are coming over, we can ask our children if there are any toys they would like to put away in a cupboard. Then we can check that they are happy for the visitors to play with everything else.



> Over time, we can help our child build skills that will empower them, so that they don’t feel like they cannot handle certain situations. Such skill building could include: • Role playing.



> Practicing easy phrases they can use to be assertive. For example, “Stop. I don’t like that.”



> Our child may take it personally that the other child isn’t as excited as they are; we can model how to accept other children the way they are.



> As adults, it is also useful to remember to check in with any child before we handle them, particularly if they are not our child.



> To help a toddler build their concentration, we start by observing them to see what they are interested in and learning to master. Then we give them time, possibility, and a prepared environment, and let them repeat the activity and allow them to deepen their concentration.



> Tips for building concentration 1. Try to avoid interrupting



> 2. Watch what they repeat



> 3. Less is more Have only a few activities available. Anything that is too easy or too difficult can be put into a storage box and rotated onto the shelves at another time.



> 4. Help as much as is needed and as little as necessary If we observe that our child is having difficulty, we can wait to see if they can manage themselves.



> 5. Have a work area A floor mat or small table can help a child focus on the activity they have chosen. When they select an activity, there is a small moment when we could help them take it to the mat or table.



> The child’s struggle is important. The child will enjoy mastering activities that are hard enough to provide a challenge, but not so difficult that they’ll give up easily. We can wait until they are about to give up and, as before, step in to give a small amount of assistance before stepping back again. Types of help we can give our child:



> Showing them. “Would you like me to show you?”



> Giving a verbal cue. “Have you tried turning it?”



> If we are going somewhere new, give them a little tour when they arrive so they feel oriented. • Always tell them where we are going rather than sneaking out.



> “I’m just going to the toilet. I’ll be back in two minutes.” Our child may cry, but over time they’ll begin to trust that we’ll come back when we say we will.



> If they are clingy, we can help them feel safe enough to explore, maybe just a little before they check in; they will gradually explore longer and go farther, and then they’ll be back again soon to check in with us.



> To remove temptation, put screens out of sight and out of reach. We can also be conscious of our own use of screens while our children are around.



> For more ideas about the “whys” and “hows” of limiting screens, I recommend the book Toxic Childhood: How the Modern World Is Damaging Our Children and What We Can Do About It, by Sue Palmer. It is very realistic and proactive about how to deal with things like technology with our children.



> If there is more than one language in the home, we can use the One Person, One Language (OPOL) approach. Each parent chooses their mother tongue when speaking with the child, while the family uses one agreed-upon “family language.” Here



> If the goal is to have the child be able to eventually study in a language, they need to spend around 30 percent of the week with that language.



> We are not aiming to be perfect parents. When I tried to be (or appeared to be) a perfect parent, I was stressed and disconnected from my family, busy worrying about everything. Rather, we are aiming to have fun and feel relaxed with our families, starting from where we are today.



> The help could be a babysitter, a grandparent, a friend who will swap with us, a partner. Our toddler will learn that there are other special people in their life whom we trust and with whom they will be safe. So it’s a win-win.



> My morning and evening rituals probably have the biggest effect on how I show up as a parent. It’s not strict, but it’s fairly consistent most days. It helps me be intentional about how I live each day, rather than reacting to what life throws at me.



> Even when my children were toddlers, I would try to wake up half an hour before anyone else in the house so I could have some quiet time for myself. If we can’t be awake before the rest of the family, consider how we can create a morning routine that we love that includes them.



> Here are some ways to practice being present: • Focus on doing one task at a time.



> Use technology consciously. I love technology. Yet we rarely switch off from it.



> Calm the mind. It’s not only technology. It’s also our mind. It’s really hard to stay in the here and now.



> Our emotional bucket is full when we feel safe, secure, loved, and accepted. It needs to be continuously refilled. When we neglect our emotional buckets, we become more reactive.



> Unless our child is in immediate danger, there is generally enough time to at least count to three in our head before reacting to any situation.



> Go slowly. It will allow us to respond rather than react.



> The biggest takeaway for me was realizing that my role as a parent is not to rush in to solve every problem for my children.



> We don’t need to be a boss giving them orders, directing them, or teaching them everything they need to learn. And we don’t need to be their servant doing everything for them.



> Every time we do something for our toddler that they can do themselves, we can make a small change so they can do it successfully by themselves—eventually



> I’d say most people think they are honest. Yet, little white lies are common: • “Tell them I’m on the phone.” (When we don’t want to speak to someone.) • “What do I think of your haircut? It looks great.” (When we don’t think that at all.) • “I don’t have any money on me.” (To a person asking for money on the street.)



> It is actually really hard to be kind and truthful. It’s something to strive to model.



> We don’t have to change these choices. Indeed, we are lucky to be able to make choices about these things at all. We can own these choices and the resulting responsibilities.



> can always say to my child (or anyone, for that matter), “I’m so sorry. I should not have . . . What I could have said/done is . . .” This sets a far stronger example for our child than blaming someone else.



> I know that I forget to acknowledge and accept where I am right now while I am striving to learn more and be a better model for my child. We often forget to say to ourselves, We are enough. We are doing our best.



> It is easy to end up making life all about the children. We put our own needs on hold or feel guilty if we do something for ourselves. We are all people, deserving of having our needs met.



> The parents did not jump up to rush to their children’s rescue during this time. Their children learned that this was their parents’ special time. They were showing their children that their relationship was important.



> Our toddlers will have other people to care for them other than us. They may have a grandparent or babysitter look after them, or they may go to day care or school. They will learn that there are other people in the world whom their parents trust with their care. They will learn to trust others. And they will learn a lot from other people’s knowledge of the world. The child’s world will be enriched by these interactions.



> When they ran out of class, I’d welcome them with a hug if they wanted it and say, “It’s so lovely to see you.” I did not need to tell them how much I missed them—that is a lot for a toddler to carry.



> They also need to trust us in this process, so we should let them know if we are leaving and be okay with the fact that this may cause them some sadness. This is easier for the child than disappearing without telling them,



> We may not like the way they talk or interact with our child, but we can always translate for them. “It sounds like Grandad does not want you to climb on the couch.” “It sounds like your mother does not want you to throw your food.”



> Within this big picture, our toddler will learn that each person in their family has their own unique approach. Indeed, they will learn naturally who to go to when they want to be silly, who to go to when not everything is right in their world, and so on.



> 1. Watch the child.



> 2. See if they can work it out themselves. Whether



> 3. What do you enjoy that you may be able to share with them? Sharing your interests can help the child have rich experiences.



> 4. Explore outside.



> 5. Give feedback about what you see.



> 6. Give your presence, not your presents.



> 7. What values do you share with their parents? This common ground is a good place to start.



> 8. Can you give the parents a sense of belonging, significance, and acceptance? Usually differences of opinion within the extended family (caregivers included) indicate a longing for acceptance.



> For the first five minutes, the other person can talk about whatever is bothering them. Listen, hear what they say, and notice the feelings that are coming up for them. For the following five minutes, we tell them what we heard them say and what we think they were feeling. They can let us know if we misunderstood anything. Then we switch roles.



> The first thing is to practice skills of independence.



> Next is to practice separation. Particularly if there has not been another caregiver helping with the toddler, we will want to practice this skill just as we would any other skill. We can start with having someone come to our house to read and play together.



> Finally, something they will do throughout their lives is practicing social skills. At the playground, we can help translate for them so they learn to use their words, guide them to stand up for themselves if needed, and model care of others.



> When our child starts school, it’s best not to have the same Montessori materials at home.



> It may be a surprise that she considered us children until the age of 24. Now brain research shows that the prefrontal cortex of the brain—the area for rational decision making and controlling social behavior—keeps developing until our early twenties.



> Infancy (0 to 6 years): the first plane of development



> The purpose of these first six years is for the child to gain physical and biological independence from their parent.



> The absorbent mind is also active during this whole period, with children from birth to 6 years being able to absorb all the information around them like a sponge.



> with an unconscious absorbent mind. In the second three years (3–6 years) the child becomes a conscious learner, the conscious absorbent mind.
