There is no such thing as spoiling a baby!

> Dr. White gave me the best mothering advice I ever received: “A baby’s wants are a baby’s needs.” Gone were the confusion and **worries about spoiling my baby, holding him too much or too little, following the clock, or nursing on demand**. It was wonderful, blessed freedom!

Every woman is different... it is ok!

> wasn’t always perfect or easy—we’ve struggled through mastitis, plugged ducts, thrush, and sore nipples. We’ve had babies who came early and babies who came late, babies who wanted to nurse constantly and babies who refused the breast altogether. We’ve had too much milk and not enough milk. We’ve worked in the home and outside. And when breastfeeding didn’t work out, there was still **a heart full of love and a parenting style that was as close to human biology** as we could make it.

## Breastmilk good for the baby

Breast milk is the best and it is always changing

> There’s no formula that comes even close to the milk your body creates. Your milk has every vitamin, mineral, and other nutritional element that your baby’s body needs, including many that haven’t been discovered or named yet, and it changes subtly through the meal, day, and year, to match subtle changes in his requirements.

Colostrum is the first milk for the baby

> Colostrum, the milk you produce in small amounts in the first couple of days after your baby is born (and which you started producing during your pregnancy), has **concentrated immunological properties** that are your baby’s first protection against all the germs he is suddenly exposed to.

Muscles in jaws are exercised and massaged

> When your baby breastfeeds, the **muscles in his jaws are exercised and massaged** in a way that causes the bones in his face and jaw to develop more fully. The **jaw that results from bottle-feeding and pacifiers is narrower**, with a higher palate that’s more likely to restrict nose breathing.

Aim to breastfeed for at least 1 year

> The child who breastfeeds for less than a year is much **more likely to need orthodontia** later on. Snoring and related breathing problems are more common as well.

Milk supply will change accordingly

> Going through a growth spurt? If your baby takes more milk than usual, he’ll have more milk available the very next time he nurses. If he drinks less than usual, your milk production scales back. Is he moving into toddlerhood and nursing less often? There will be more immune factors in your milk to keep him covered.

Normal good health + IQ

> Breastfeeding doesn’t reduce the risk of infection, illness, and disease. It doesn’t add IQ points. Breastfeeding results in **normal good health and normal IQ**. When babies aren’t breastfed—and this is using the same information from the same studies, just shifting the focus to the true experimental group—they are at **increased risk for all those short-term and long-term illnesses and diseases**.

## Breastfeeding is good for the mother

Natural contraception

> If you breastfeed exclusively (without giving water, solids, or formula) and your baby nurses often, including at least once during the night, then **your periods most likely won’t come back for at least six months**.

Lose weight naturally

> Breastfeeding helps many (not all) **women lose weight readily**. Nature gave you some of that pregnancy weight just for the purpose of making milk in the first few months. The natural design is for it to melt away by the time your baby is well started on solids.

Less risk to cancer

> Breastfeeding is also an insurance policy against **breast, uterine, and cervical cancer**. It may be that the lower estrogen level of lactation provides the protection; the longer you breastfeed, the stronger your insurance. This doesn’t mean it’s impossible for you to get these cancers if you breastfeed, but you are less susceptible to them.





> These hormones, prolactin and oxytocin, not only foster a connection with your baby, they also help you recover from the emotional and physical stress of birth. Without these hormones, mothers tend to talk to their babies less, interact less, touch less.



> With all this intimate time together, you get to know his body and his personality better than anyone else. You know how to interpret his cries sooner than your partner. You know what makes him happy and what he doesn’t like. Day by day, breastfeeding builds your confidence and mothering skills.



> No cans of formula or bottles, no washing, sterilizing, or storing. No measuring, spilling, or heating. No planning, leftovers, or spoilage. Most likely a lot fewer trips to the doctor. Your milk is always available, always the right temperature, and never spoiled, no matter how hot or cold it is outside. The money that you don’t spend on formula in a year could pay for a high-end appliance.



> Nipple sensitivity is common in the early days. But if breastfeeding actually hurts, that’s your body’s signal to change something. As Christina Smillie, a physician specializing in breastfeeding, says, “Pain is the body’s way of guiding us to find a more comfortable position.



> despite all the best information and help, you aren’t able to make a full milk supply, you can still breastfeed successfully. There are many mothers who nurse very satisfactorily with a partial milk supply. They supplement to make up for the amount of milk they can’t make, but their main focus is on the milk they can make.



> Based on research, the World Health Organization and many national pediatric associations around the world advise exclusive breastfeeding (no other drinks or solid foods) for about six months, with solid foods gradually added and breastfeeding continuing for at least two years.



> For now, focus on feeding your new baby and getting help if you need it. Then, when breastfeeding is going smoothly, you’ll be able to make decisions about when you want to stop from a position of strength, instead of stopping because you had no choice.



> Nursing Clothes? Not Really Clothes made especially for nursing with hidden flaps and access to the breasts are nice but certainly not necessary; most mothers just wear a top that’s loose enough to pull up from the hem.



> Nursing Bras? Not Necessarily Bras are never a health necessity; if you’re happy bra-less, stay bra-less. If you like wearing one, figure that whatever you wore in your last trimester will probably fit after your baby’s born, though your cup size may run somewhat bigger for the first couple of months. You’ll probably want two or three.



> It’s a good idea to avoid underwires, at least at first. They can cut across milk-making tissue and increase the risk of milk plugs or infections. Avoid any bra that’s tight enough to leave marks on your skin.



> They come in many different styles and fabrics, but cotton is usually the most comfortable. Better-quality nursing bras stand up better to a lot of wear and tear.



> Both disposable and washable brands are available. Or you can make your own washable pads from layers of soft cotton circles sewn together.



> If you want to have one for unexpected separations or the occasional night out with your partner, hand expression or a good-quality manual pump may be all you need.



> But mothers who lean back slightly when they nurse, or who simply cross one knee over the other, may have no need for a nursing stool at all.



> Soft Carrier? Almost Always! One of the most helpful tools of motherhood is a cloth carrier, sling, or wrap, so you can “wear” your baby while you go about your day, inside or out. Babies get heavy fast, and it’s much easier on your back and arms to have your baby secured to you in fabric that holds him against your body You can use a carrier from birth until he is about 35–40 pounds (16–18 kg)—much heavier than you’d be able to manage with a car seat.



> Having your hands free is great. But baby wearing is even more important to your baby. Research shows that babies who aren’t “worn” by adults for much of the day fuss more than those who are.41



> They’re not only baby carriers, they’re also a clean surface for diaper changing (in a pinch) and a blanket to cover a sleeping baby. Most people won’t be able to tell when you nurse your baby in a sling. Some even have pockets for your cell phone and keys. And there are sizes to fit all body types.



> Bend at the waist, cup your hands under each breast, and gently move your hands in an up-and-down motion, as if fluffing a pillow. It will give your breasts a chance to shift and move a bit.



> The hormonal “wall” that held back milk production comes down when your placenta is delivered. In the first few days, the alveoli continue to secrete colostrum. The sugar and fat content rise dramatically on about the third or fourth day, pulling additional water (and many other elements) into the alveoli, so your milk is now whiter and increased in volume.



> During the first two weeks, the extra sugar, water, and fats keep increasing the volume. All of this will happen whether or not milk is removed. Even if you do nothing at all—even if you don’t want to breastfeed—your body’s going to do everything it can to feed your baby.



> By about ten days, you’re near full production, and your supply won’t increase much from about one month on.



> Milk removal is especially important during the first two to three weeks because that’s when your milk production capability is established. It’s like “calibrating” your milk supply, and it happens all over again with each new baby.



> The more milk you remove during the early weeks, the more milk you’ll be able to make for this baby. If you don’t remove much milk in the first few weeks, it will be harder (but not impossible) to make more milk later on.



> It’s made more rapidly when the breast is less full. The fuller the breast, the more slowly milk is made. This is why your milk production slows down if you wait to feed your baby until your breasts “fill up.”



> In traditional tribes, where babies are part of everyday life, the new mom and dad have been watching other parents since they were babies themselves, and they’ve absorbed most of the skills they need without even trying. They’ve had plenty of chances to practice, too, because they’ve been carrying and soothing and entertaining babies—their own siblings and cousins and neighbors—for many years.



> But there are a gazillion ways to bond with a baby without bottle-feeding—in fact, partners have the key role of teaching the baby that love sometimes comes without food. Some partners take over bath time. Your partner might like to let the baby have daily “tummy time” by leaning back on the couch, baby on chest, or by wearing the baby in a wrap or sling



> Partners can often help by doing everything but feeding. They can take charge of diaper changes (most babies’ favorite non-nursing activity after the early weeks), bring you a drink or snack (or both), and take baby off for a relaxing walk or in-arms snooze when the feeding ends.



> The baby can learn to like the fast, steady flow from the bottle and get frustrated at the breast because the milk flows more slowly at first. There’s also an effect on your milk production. If the baby is getting bottles and you don’t pump or express your milk, your breasts will make less milk.



> Remind her that this part is temporary. Most women feel it takes at least six weeks to start to have a handle on this motherhood thing. Life will settle down. But it takes a while.



> A complex hormonal sequence during labor sets us and our babies up to take on our new roles with confidence and enthusiasm, and if that sequence is disrupted too much, both early motherhood and breastfeeding can be harder.



> You can improve your odds for a smooth start to breastfeeding by planning for a birth with as few interventions as possible.



> Breastfeeding is likely to begin more smoothly if you read at least one book that promotes normal birth, take a childbirth class that gives lots of non-medical ways to handle all kinds of labors, and find a birth helper who is experienced in helping to keep births normal.



> You didn’t always get a break when you wanted to, but you did get periodic rests. And if you didn’t, your muscles gave out and made you stop. Muscles just can’t work beyond their own ability. Same with labor. Natural contractions always stop within your ability to cope, because it’s your own unmedicated muscles that are doing the work. You get a break after every surge of work. And you relax from each surge almost instantly, just as you do at the gym. It’s very different from an injury-based pain. Labor is an effort-based pain, nothing more.



> If the induction requires many hours of IV fluids, often with synthetic oxytocin, the added fluids may increase breast engorgement3 in the mother and weight loss in the baby. And a baby who was not quite ready to be born—even if just by a few days—may have more difficulty breathing and coordinating sucking and swallowing when he tries to breastfeed.



> At first, Em just feels the same old Braxton-Hicks contractions—those “warm-up exercises” that her uterus has been doing for months. Gradually, she notices that they’re a little stronger or lower than usual, a little harder to ignore.



> Eating and drinking as much as you want to in labor4 gives you more energy to manage your contractions, the birth, and those amazing first hours after your baby arrives.



> Our biology says we shouldn’t labor in a risky place, and being with strangers or in a strange place can signal risk to the unconscious part of our brains that controls labor.



> Without a doula, women who birth in a hospital are more likely to: Have an epidural or other pain medication Have an instrumental vaginal birth Have a Cesarean Have synthetic oxytocin during labor Have a baby with a low five-minute Apgar score Have a baby admitted to the special care nursery Rate their birth experience negatively Recall severe labor pain



> Like any athlete, she’s too focused to smile or chat. Her body releases endorphins, the same pain-relieving hormones7 that athletes’ bodies release during a tough, satisfying workout. No one checks her cervix to see if it is “time to push.” That’s something Em will gradually sense for herself, just as any mammal would.



> Having to lie still or lie on your back during labor has been shown to lengthen labor,8 increase the desire for medications, and make it more difficult to position the baby well for birth—all of which can interfere with breastfeeding.



> Epidurals can cause your temperature to rise, which raises your baby’s temperature. He may be sent to the nursery for observation and antibiotics in case he has an infection.



> In response to the pressure, her cervix, vagina, and perineum (the tissues around the vaginal outlet) loosen up, becoming stretchier, ready for the baby to pass through. Waiting until her body wants to start pushing means Em has less risk of tearing or needing help10 to get the baby out, and that means a faster recovery.



> There is a short period of burning when it seems that her skin must surely give way completely, but then Abe’s head emerges facedown and automatically turns to the side, so that his shoulders can slip through on their own, first one and then the other. And then his body tumbles out in a gush of amniotic fluid.



> Along with those first breaths, his movements against her belly cause her uterus to contract again, and the placenta separates from her uterus. Abe’s skin color changes from purplish to rosy, and the umbilical cord that has been his lifeline stops pulsing. There’s no rush to cut it.



> Babies squeeze through the birth canal with only about two-thirds of their blood, which makes them a smaller package. The rest comes “on board” afterward through the cord. By waiting until the cord stops pulsing,13 the baby gets his full supply of blood. And that means his resulting iron stores are high—enough to last comfortably for six or nine or more months while he begins to add other food sources to his diet.



> Skin to Skin After a few minutes of cleaning and cuddling, Em settles back comfortably in a semi-reclining position, with Abe on her chest and the blanket over the two of them. Because his bare skin is against her bare skin, Em warms Abe quickly and precisely.



> Her colostrum (early milk) moves through her breasts in a small gush, reinforcing Abe’s sucking efforts. Thick and small in quantity, it’s just the thing for practicing sucking, swallowing, and breathing. It provides a protective, anti-infective coating for his brand-new intestinal tract19 and stimulates his first bowel movements.



> Research finds that home birth is just as safe as hospital birth for low-risk pregnancies,20 with a lower rate of interventions and higher rates of breastfeeding success and maternal satisfaction.



> CHANGING YOUR MIND Almost any birth decision can be changed, at just about any time. More than one woman has changed her planned birth place or caregiver in her last month of pregnancy. Trust your feelings. You don’t owe people and places your loyalty; you owe yourself and your baby peace of mind and a smooth transition.



> Protect your privacy and treat the room as your (temporary) home. Keep the door at least partly closed and have your labor support person “approve” anyone who comes in. Bring your favorite music. Put your own pictures up with poster adhesive. Wear your own clothes (with warm socks if the room is cool). As long as you’re comfortable, stay on your feet. You’re a competent person, not a patient. Walking and moving help line your baby up and keep labor going. Wander the halls or go outdoors, taking a helper with you. Cover the clock. When labor really gets under way, you won’t care much about time, anyway. Avoid routine vaginal exams, which increase the risk of infection and cause stress. You’ll know when you feel like pushing!



> If the hospital requires an IV for all laboring women, even though it isn’t supported by research and could waterlog both you and the baby and delay your milk coming in, consider asking for a hep-lock instead.



> The bathroom can be a good place to labor. Try sitting backward on the toilet, resting your head on your arms. We’re used to relaxing and opening up on a toilet. A shower can help you relax deeply. Soaking up to your neck in a tub can be an amazing comfort.



> Remember that the staff are there to support you, so let them know what you need—like extra pillows, a darkened room, or a closed door.



> Avoid routine external fetal monitoring.21 Research indicates that its main result has been to increase the number of unnecessary Cesareans.



> Ask the medical staff not to offer you medication or an epidural. Instead, have your doula and midwife suggest other simple comfort measures. Gravity can help you, if you find a comfortable upright or side-lying position for pushing. Gravity works against you if you lie flat on your back.



> Take off the baby hat. It’s a holdover from the days when babies were taken away and were at risk of losing body heat. Your baby is lying on a furnace—you.



> Keep the baby with you, on your body, bare skin against bare skin, at least until after he has that first nursing, which could continue off and on for several hours. There’s ample research to support the importance of skin-to-skin contact immediately after birth and during the hours that follow.



> Research indicates that the “too-big,” “convenience,” and “new standard of care” reasons have not only increased the number of inductions, they’ve also increased the risk of prematurity and surgical delivery.



> You may want to ask that misoprostol (Cytotec)24 not be used. It can result in very intense contractions, beyond what your body and your baby are designed to handle, and can result in serious complications, especially if you’ve had a previous C-section.



> Consider asking that any artificial oxytocin used to jump-start your labor be given at intervals instead of continuously.



> You may want to ask that your doctor or midwife not rupture your membranes (break your water) to help get labor going or speed up the induction process. It does very little to speed labor, and once your membranes have been ruptured, many caregivers limit how long labor can continue, with a C-section as the next step.



> In many parts of today’s world, one mother in three leaves the hospital with an abdominal incision; in some places the rates are even higher. This is way beyond the 10 to 15 percent that the World Health Organization finds reasonable, but it’s still a reality that every pregnant woman needs to prepare for.



> The effects of medications and IV fluids, and the difficulty in finding comfortable positions for breastfeeding when your abdomen is tender from surgery, can make breastfeeding more difficult. And it’s challenging to recover from major surgery and look after a new baby at the same time. This doesn’t mean that you can’t breastfeed after a C-section



> If possible, don’t schedule a C-section; let labor begin on its own since even a little labor is good for both of you. Your body gets to go through labor’s hormonal setup,



> You may want to have someone describe the birth (not the surgery) to you—the moment that hair, then face, then body are visible, and the bringing forth of your baby into the world.



> Consider asking the surgeon to delay cutting the cord, and to hold the baby low until the cord stops pulsing. It won’t take long. Once the cord is cut, ask that your baby be brought to you right away, for you to see and touch.



> His smell and touch can go a long way toward emotional healing from the surgery. More and more hospitals are doing this because they recognize how much more smoothly breastfeeding goes when mother and baby are kept together. Some have even noted that the uterus clamps down more quickly and satisfactorily if the baby’s sucking drives the process.



> Skin-to-skin contact is what your baby expects. The feeling of that warm little body against yours is pretty wonderful for you, too.



> If absolutely everything you didn’t want happens to you, or even if your birth just isn’t what you hoped, this was still your story and nobody else’s. It’s a story that you will probably want to tell in detail someday to a caring friend or maybe even to your child. At some point—even years later—it can help to write it down. The good parts and the bad parts, what you saw and did, and how you felt. Your story will become precious to you for exactly what it is—the beginning of your life with your child. There



> When a baby is born, his instincts and reflexes help him crawl to the nipple and latch on, even if you don’t help at all. But most of the time you’ll want to help—and that’s instinctive, too!



> Until now, your baby was fed continuously through the umbilical cord, and she’s designed to expect frequent feedings now. So she may nurse, let go, and doze for a bit, then wake and start looking for the nipple again. That’s normal. It’s how a good milk supply and a well-fed baby get started.



> What hit me smack in the face was the realization that in this position, with baby on his/her tummy on TOP of a slightly reclining mom, the earth’s magical gravity does most of the work. When I have the mother sitting more straight up, the mother needs to help the baby much more. What a difference!”



> approaches tend to work so well. Like any other baby mammal, your baby gets to organize himself, sense his landmarks, and choose his own moment.



> If you hold him so that your nipple falls in the space between his upper lip and nose, he can tip his head back slightly to take it into his mouth. Or let his cheek come to rest just above your nipple and help him move to take it into his mouth.



> Your first job is to calm your baby. If he’s upset, take time to soothe him. Bring him up higher on your chest, stroke him, talk to him in the voice that he already knows so well. You’ll gradually learn what calms your baby. It also helps to begin when your baby gives early cues for wanting to eat—sucking on his hand, smacking his lips, turning his head toward you—rather than waiting until he’s crying from hunger.



> Your baby’s lower jaw needs to be deeply placed on your breast. His upper jaw isn’t all that important for nursing. Rest your index finger under your nose like a mustache—on your upper jaw—and make exaggerated chewing motions.



> While there might be some milk in your nipple, the milk is mostly in the ducts in your breast. The baby who just chews on a nipple won’t get much, and it’ll hurt! When your baby has a good big mouthful of breast beyond your nipple, that’s when it’s comfortable. And that’s where the milk is. So when it feels good, it is good.



> His jaw does much better if he lifts his chin so that his head tips back slightly, chin in firm contact with the breast, nose lifted free or nearly free of the breast. Tipping his head back a bit helps with swallowing, too; it’s easier to swallow when our chin is lifted than when it’s tucked.



> Good breastfeeding has nothing to do with how good it looks, and everything to do with how good it feels and how well it works. Your baby is nursing well IF he is able to get the milk he needs without getting too tired AND you both feel comfortable.



> A full-term, healthy baby does not need any food or liquids for at least twenty-four to thirty-six hours. Nature provides this buffer to give babies and mothers time to figure things out. Many babies wake up to nurse just fine the next day. The “Three Keeps”



> 1. Keep Your Milk Flowing Your milk supply will start to increase automatically after the first couple of days, whether you remove milk or not.



> If your baby isn’t nursing yet, it will help if you start now to hand-express or pump, so that your breasts will be ready and waiting, with plenty of milk, when your baby is finally able to nurse.



> Most mothers can express more colostrum in the first hours post-birth than they get later—that’s the large first meal your baby would normally get. You can ask for help expressing it if your baby isn’t nursing.



> It’s helpful to express for about fifteen minutes on each side every two to three hours, using breast massage to encourage more milk.



> Even if he was nursing beautifully, he wouldn’t be getting huge amounts at first. In fact, there’s some evidence that giving lots of food at first may rev up his metabolism and cause him to require more. A little colostrum goes a long way.



> 3. Keep Your Baby Close Your baby’s bare skin against your own bare skin really helps encourage breastfeeding in a baby who’s still getting himself organized. With a covering over the two of you that keeps you warm, your baby will be just as warm.



> These feeding times should be relaxed, happy, and low-pressure. Play at breastfeeding when you both feel like it, instead of working at it because it’s mealtime. Time, trust in the process, and a skilled helper are your best allies.



> worry that the mother won’t be able to “keep the faith” until it happens. It will work, and in the meantime there are ways to keep your milk supply strong. Babies are built to breastfeed. Early babies, small babies, sick babies—they’re all designed to feed themselves at breast.



> It takes time for you and your baby to really get the hang of this new skill. Fortunately, you’ll be breastfeeding very frequently and getting LOTS of opportunities to practice. Eventually you’ll be able to nurse on this chair and that sofa, in a parked car and in the park, lying on your side in bed or sitting cross-legged on the floor, even getting up to answer the door.



> For at least the first two hours of your baby’s life, the two of you deserve to be—need to be—together, with your bare or diaper-only baby on your bare skin,1 chest to chest.



> regular blanket over both of you is all you need. Study after study shows the importance of this skin-to-skin contact. Measurements, ointments, everything can wait. This is your time together. It comes once in both your lives.



> Skin-to-skin contact after birth helps to: Stabilize your baby’s heart rate, breathing, and temperature Stabilize your own temperature Prevent baby blues later on Reduce your baby’s stress



> Reduce your baby’s pain from medical procedures Reduce your stress Increase interactions between you and your baby Increase the likelihood and length of breastfeeding



> There aren’t many diapers to change at first. The colostrum your baby gets from your breasts is small in quantity, which is perfect because his stomach is about the size of a large marble at birth. His first poop will be sticky and black—that’s the meconium, the wastes that filled your baby’s intestines before he was born.



> You’ll be having what seems like a heavy menstrual period that can last for a couple of weeks. This is called lochia and at times the flow can be really heavy. Standing up your first time can cause quite a gush.



> When you breastfeed your baby, your uterus will contract in response to the oxytocin released by the baby’s suckling, and you may get a gush of blood each time.



> You can’t sleep. Part of it is the mental turmoil of having made the leap into motherhood. Then there’s the shift in hormones—pregnancy levels of progesterone and estrogen drop quickly after birth. And being a new mother raises your radar so that you sleep more lightly and wake more easily, especially if your baby isn’t with you.



> You start leaking from everywhere. We’ve already mentioned lochia. Some women also find they have temporary bladder issues—leaking a little urine if they cough or sneeze. As your milk comes in, you may find that you can’t keep a shirt dry. Also temporary.



> These first few nights can be tough! Take plenty of naps, even an evening nap, and prepare your bedtime nest.



> You might want to have water or juice beside your bed as well—new mothers can get very thirsty. Your nights will settle down, but not instantly.



> How long? Your baby can nurse as long as he wants to. An unmedicated baby may nurse for an hour or more at a time in the first few days. A medicated, sleepy baby may need encouragement.



> Unmedicated babies who stay with their mothers tend to nurse more than the eight to twelve times a day you often hear about, interspersed with some serious napping. They’re putting in their order for abundant milk.



> Start about six hours after birth and aim for at least eight feedings in twenty-four hours. He should be giving clear feeding signals within a week, once he can think straight, and then you can relax and follow his lead.



> If you want to go to the bathroom or get a snack, just slip a finger in the corner of your baby’s mouth to break the suction and do what you need to do. (One simple approach is to use a finger about the size of your nipple. Slide it into the corner of his mouth, between his gums, and turn your finger as you’d turn a screwdriver in a paint can lid.



> Rooming-in is the more common arrangement today in hospitals, with the baby in a bassinet or Isolette in the same room as the mother. You can have your baby on your chest, in your arms, or at your side as much as you like during the day, but many hospitals don’t want a mother to have her baby in her bed at night.



> Your newborn’s sterile intestines are open to whatever comes along. And they’re truly “open,” so that illness- or allergy-promoting substances can slip through into your baby’s bloodstream. His intestines need two things right from the start: your milk, to help set up the right bacteria and provide a temporary seal against infections, and time, to mature and create his own solid seal against illness- and allergy-promoting “leaks.”



> may mean that your baby’s intestinal bacteria are never quite the protective ones that an exclusively breastfed baby has. A little formula after that can alter your baby’s protective intestinal bacteria for a full month. A little formula anytime in the first few months, before the intestines are well sealed, can increase the risk of allergy and diabetes in susceptible children. The risk may be highest in the first few days and in babies born even a little early.



> In fact, for full-term babies what comes out is generally a good way to gauge what went in. At first, it’s not much. In the first twenty-four hours, if you get nothing more than a slightly wet diaper and a black, tarry diaper, you and your baby are doing absolutely fine.



> By the third day, expect to see real changes in the color of those poops. And by the end of the week, you’ll probably be well into yellow poops and noticeably heavy diapers.



> About the third day, you may notice orange-red deposits in the diaper. This is commonly known as “brick dust” or urate crystals and is highly concentrated urine from not getting enough fluid. It’s very normal for breastfed babies on the third day right before the milk comes in and will be gone as soon as the milk volume increases.



> you continue to see these deposits after the fifth day, especially if your baby is having fewer than three poops a day, contact your baby’s doctor and your breastfeeding helper.



> Conventional wisdom these days says that babies shouldn’t lose more than 7 percent of their body weight before they start gaining,5 absolutely shouldn’t lose any more than 10 percent, and should be back at birth weight by two weeks. But there are some problems with these guidelines. The mother who’s had a lot of IV fluids may deliver a baby who has also had a lot of IV fluids. He’ll be born at an artificially high weight and seem to lose more than he really does.



> your baby has lost considerable weight but is eager and organized when he eats, swallowing well, and starting to produce more diapers, then he’s probably doing fine. Watch to make sure his good progress continues; it most likely will.



> The extra milk expression will do two things: get more food into him so that he starts pooping, and wake your breasts up to remind them that there’s a baby here!



> Hypothermia, hypoglycemia, jaundice, engorgement, and excessive infant weight loss are all problems related to sleepiness and separation. And the best way to avoid sleepiness and separation is to bring your baby into the world unmedicated, and to keep him on or against your body most of the time in the early days.



> When he drifts off to sleep at the breast, don’t move him except to pillow his head more comfortably on your breast. Don’t try to burp him—just snuggle with him until he falls into a deeper sleep with even breathing and no eyelid movement, so he’s less likely to be disturbed by being moved.



> Here are some ideas to help wake her up: If there will be a bright light in her eyes, dim it. Is she facing a window? Pull the drape. It’s much easier for her to keep her eyes open if she doesn’t have to squint. Undress her. This may do the trick all by itself, but if it doesn’t, put her skin-to-skin against your chest and see if that helps. Stroke her and call her name. Rub her feet. Maybe wipe her face with a damp cloth. Handle her gently. No luck? Lay her on the bed on her back, no wrappings, so that she can’t feel you at all.



> If your baby has been taken from you and comes back swaddled—wrapped up like a burrito—just unwrap him (he is, after all, your baby) and snuggle his bare or lightly clothed skin against yours, with your blankets over both of you. He’ll quickly regain the heat he was losing, and you can keep him with you from that point on.



> Swaddling is popular at the moment, but there’s research that raises alarms.6 The swaddled newborn has poorer circulation. His temperature is lower, and so is his mother’s. He gains weight more slowly, probably because he is less able to signal hunger and is maybe less aware that he is hungry.



> If she has fallen asleep nursing, it’s partly because her level of2 cholecystokinin (CCK) has risen. In a newborn, a high level of this hormone makes a baby sleepy and tells her that she’s full; a low level can wake her and tell her she’s hungry.



> Sucking on a pacifier releases CCK, too. A baby can fall asleep with a pacifier, thinking she’s been fed. But really she’s been fooled out of a meal, and your breasts have lost a feeding’s worth of milk removal. Result: slower weight gain and lower supply. CCK



> All this nursing right now makes sense. Your baby will never be less skilled at this than she is right now. She’ll never have a smaller mouth, tongue, and stomach to work with than she has right now. Her intestines aren’t very efficient yet. And yet she’ll never grow faster than she’ll be growing in the next few weeks.



> After the transition from meconium in the first few days, lots of green poops can result from too much milk (though if you let an ordinary yellowish poop sit for a while, it will turn greenish in color), a diet heavy in greens that are rich in iron, green food coloring, taking iron supplements (including prenatal vitamins containing iron), or bilirubin excretion during the first week or



> The diapers of breastfed babies tend to smell like buttermilk, bread, even cheddar cheese or popcorn—yeasty or sharp, but not at all unpleasant. It makes sense.



> HOW TO KNOW YOUR BABY’S DOING WELL Weight gain. Look for a return to birth weight by two weeks.



> Diapers. Look for at least three “okay” (thumb and forefinger circle size) diapers each day during the first month or so.



> Your breasts. Look for comfortable nipples, a milk release within a minute (usually much sooner), and noticeable softening by the end of most nursings. Nursing behavior. Look for open eyes when the feed starts, periods of slow (about one per second) sucks with periodic pauses, and finishing within a half hour at most feeds. Disposition between nursings. Look for the baby falling gently asleep toward the end of the nursing (or contentment for at least a while before he nurses again), limp hands, and an unworried expression most of the time. What doesn’t matter. How many minutes on each breast, whether he falls asleep at the breast at the end of the feeding, or whether he nurses



> Within the first few weeks post-birth, your breasts size up the situation and develop hormone receptors that work with your breastfeeding hormones to provide enough milk for the new baby or babies, based on how much milk is removed. This process expects milk to be taken out frequently and efficiently by the baby, but it responds to milk removal by any means—nursing, pumping, hand expressing. The more milk that is removed during this time, the higher your long-term milk supply will be.6



> There are only two things that matter about your nursing technique: 1. Are you and your baby comfortable? (He’ll let you know if he isn’t.) 2. Is he getting plenty of milk? Beyond that, there are no rules!



> One way to increase the amount of milk your baby gets during a feeding is by compressing (and holding) the breast while he’s nursing (you can also do this while pumping).



> Here are some guidelines you can give them for food:8 Healthy—think whole grains, unprocessed meats, fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables, with smaller amounts of dairy High-calorie—think nut butters, olive and canola oils, whole-milk cheeses and yogurts, even that leftover birthday cake One-handed—think casseroles, sandwiches, finger foods, hummus-type dips, whole-grain crackers, pre-sliced nibblies, smoothies Sturdy—think freezable, reheatable, long refrigerator life



> Relax in that position as much as you can, whenever you can, whether he’s eating or sleeping. Rest, with or without sleep, speeds healing and helps keep you from feeling overwhelmed.



> Also called the colic hold, this has been a helpful calming technique for just about every well-fed but fussy baby we’ve met.



> Now add the baby bounce. You can start with swaying, but it may be that he needs at least a sway with a hitch in it.



> Pre-Soothing Why wait for the wail? Ron Barr, a professor of pediatrics who has studied infant crying around the world, recommends “Carry, Contact, Walk, and Talk” for soothing an unhappy baby, and has found that doing these before the crying starts will mean less crying overall.



> Like so many issues during the first few weeks, fussiness is almost always temporary. Enjoy your baby’s moments of contentment, do your best to soothe his distresses, and know that he’s no happier about his unhappiness than you are! There’s



> How Often Do Babies Eat? It’s going to vary, not only from baby to baby but also from day to day and month to month as your baby grows. Instead of looking at frequency, try looking at how your baby behaves after a nursing. Does he stay awake for a bit after some nursings, looking at you calmly for a few minutes before wanting another snack? Does he drift off to sleep while nursing sometimes? Does his arm drop like a dead weight when you lift it as he sleeps? Those are all signs that he’s setting his own pace just fine, just as any mammal baby would, even if it’s much more frequent than you expected.



> In contrast, the baby who sleeps through most of his meals, which are usually long and slow, may be using numerous sucks to get every swallow of milk. It takes a lot of time and energy to eat that way, and these babies doze as much as they can. But take them off the breast and their eyes fly open.



> You may have heard that foremilk is the thin, low-fat milk that comes at the beginning of the feeding, and hindmilk is the creamy, high-fat milk that finishes the feeding. Well … Your breasts make only one kind of milk. The reason it can seem different is that cream rises. If you nurse really often, it all stays swirled together.



> Our milk supplies are designed for the same system. If we wait until our breasts feel really full, they’ve already started to slow down production. Our milk production stays highest when we nurse before we need to.



> A baby starts with subtle nursing cues—eyelids fluttering open, hands coming toward her face, mouth movements. Then she adds more obvious ones—rooting toward your chest, whimpering. If you offer to nurse by then, she’ll probably take your breast gently and easily. As her hunger builds, her body and mouth tense. She gets distracted and starts to cry.



> As the American Academy of Pediatrics states, “Crying is a late indicator of hunger.”



> These early weeks are a time for getting your milk supply and your baby’s growth well established. Life will get simpler. For now, expect newborn inefficiency, follow your baby’s lead, and take another look to see if he’s actually more content than you thought.



> Try going totally with your baby and you’ll probably see a happier baby and more poopy diapers within a day or two, though it can take longer to turn a milk supply around if it’s dipped too low.



> Certain herbs and foods also have been used throughout the world to increase milk production (see Chapter 18). But there’s nothing in particular that you need to eat to make enough nutritious milk. Likewise, you don’t need to drink anything in particular—it doesn’t take milk to make milk.



> Some cultures whose diet includes spicy foods have a special, milder diet for nursing mothers for the first month or so. But after about the first month most babies are not bothered by any foods in their mother’s diet. Your favorite foods will flavor your milk somewhat, and your baby will learn the family menu through breastfeeding.



> Go easy on caffeine14 for the first month or so while your baby’s body is still maturing enough to handle it. Watch him for jitteriness once you add it, and go light enough that you can nap easily when you get the chance.



> Cultures that carry their babies don’t understand the notion of burping a baby. The baby who is carried upright most of the time will naturally burp when he needs to. Burping a baby is probably something we developed when we started laying them down after a big meal, which tends to trap air in their stomachs.



> Slings are designed to carry babies from birth through toddlerhood, so it’s no surprise that they can be awkward at first. Your newborn will probably do best in a snug sling, so that he’s stabilized in a fairly upright position with his head at about the level of your breasts, not down by your waist.



> So arrange your baby with his face above the level of the sling. Start moving as soon as he’s settled, patting him through the fabric and talking to him.



> Sucking on a pacifier can trick the CCK system and the baby’s weight gain will suffer. In the early weeks especially, if a baby wants to suck, he wants to eat, pure and simple. A pacifier is like sugarless gum for someone who’s trying to double his weight in a matter of months. It can reduce intake at a time when a baby is meant to grow quickly.



> Mothers who rely on pacifiers tend to develop fewer baby-calming skills of their own. Children who use pacifiers in day care are more prone to thrush and ear infections.16 Latex pacifiers have been linked to latex allergies. Prolonged use can affect mouth development,17 raising a child’s palate and crowding his teeth, as well as narrowing his nasal passages and leading to an increased risk of sleep apnea and later speech problems.



> Many babies simply can’t wait the length of time the books propose, or they can’t do it and gain weight and keep your supply in good shape. Setting up a schedule risks an underfed baby and early weaning—and a more complicated life.



> Here’s unscheduled nursing two months from now: Going to the grocery store? Top the baby off with a quick nursing before you go and you can shop longer without stopping. (Babies rarely refuse these little extras when you offer. In fact, the little extras are what really make them grow.)



> You can do any of these and more while you nurse the baby. One of this book’s writers, Diana, wrote most of her first book with a nursing baby in her lap. Nursing, once you and your baby have had some practice, is just not that big a deal.



> Nursing had to fit into a day of finding food (often unpredictable), tending animals (ditto), and avoiding sudden dangers (ditto again). Raising a baby had to be all about flexibility, and it was, and it worked just fine.



> But your days probably aren’t fully smooth and comfortable yet. New mothers in our culture often say it takes them six weeks or more to feel “settled.”



> By six weeks, you may even begin to see social smiles, with eyes open and looking right at you, a very big reward for your many weeks of nurturing.



> Pain is a signal that something needs to be different, no matter how good “the latch” looks! If you haven’t tried that laid-back breastfeeding position, give it a whirl.



> You’re the one with the breast “snack tray;” why not be a good hostess and offer whenever your baby seems unsettled? No need to force the issue if you guessed wrong. But your baby can’t nurse if the offer isn’t made.



> In the past, mothers were often told to feed on a schedule1—every three or four hours. When research showed that this led to breastfeeding problems, and we came to understand better how breastfeeding works, the recommendation changed to “feed the baby when he gives you hunger cues.”



> Nursing is your baby’s first human relationship. It’s how she first communicates with you, and how you communicate with her. Those deep gazes that the two of you share at times are communication, too, but you’ve probably found that they’re short-lived at this age.



> The phrase “he’s just using you as a pacifier” works against confident, smooth-running breastfeeding. Nursing is how a baby grows; why hold back?



> By six weeks, though, many women find that their breasts don’t feel full anymore. Their breasts feel fairly soft most of the time,2 and feel full only if the baby goes longer than usual between nursings. If you used to leak a lot, you may not be leaking as much anymore, either. Supply and demand have balanced.



> So don’t worry if your breasts are softer now, or if they never were very full. The same guideline applies: a happy, thriving baby who’s growing well and filling diapers is nursing just fine.



> Here are some signs of a thriving baby at this age. Your baby: Begins gaining weight after your milk comes in. Passes birth weight by at least ten to fourteen days. Is gaining weight appropriately.3 The average rate is roughly 1 ounce (about 30 g) per day during the early months, but remember that’s only an average and your baby may gain more or less than that.



> Has at least three yellow poops (about the size of the circle your thumb and forefinger make—an “okay” sign for an “okay” diaper) and five colorless, odorless, and heavy wet diapers each day. Doesn’t have trouble latching on, and doesn’t have trouble staying attached.



> The single most common cause of crying is simply a baby missing his mother, which is why babies who aren’t held cry significantly more than babies who are5 (especially around six weeks).



> People Say I Shouldn’t Pick Him Up Every Time He Cries You might ask them what their concern is. Spoiling? Whether your baby is crying for a physical or emotional need, he isn’t trying to “get his way” or control you; he’s just asking for help because he can’t help himself.



> babies spend their early years laying down many, many nerve pathways. Some pathways result in anxiety and stress, and some result in confidence and coping. Research indicates that the way a mother responds to her baby greatly influences whether her child will respond automatically with calm or stress to the world around him as he matures. Refusing to answer his cries for help lays down “no one cares” pathways, decreasing his trust; making him feel neglected, hopeless, and despairing; decreasing his feelings of self-worth; and wiring his brain to react to future stresses more intensely.



> No, you can’t spoil your baby by responding to his needs. It’s not possible at this age. What you can do by responding quickly and reliably is to help develop the neural pathways in his brain that make him a secure, resilient person for the rest of his life.



> Back in the heyday of formula, the official word was usually to keep new babies at home for weeks or months. It wasn’t a bad idea; a formula-fed baby’s immune system is so limited that he’s much more susceptible to illness.



> It’s not going out that makes a baby sick; it’s being held by sick people. Encourage others to wash their hands before holding the baby, and follow your instincts on whether or not you want to pass him around.



> Some things you can try to make it simpler: Practice at home or with friends—in front of a mirror if you want to see what others see. Wear clothes that you can nurse in comfortably. They don’t have to be special nursing clothes; two-piece outfits with tops that you can pull up from the bottom work just as well.



> A cardigan sweater covers anything your baby’s body doesn’t. You can also wear a tank top underneath your top, with circles cut out for nursing. Your outer shirt covers the circles, and the rest of the tank top covers anything that your outer shirt doesn’t.



> Dark-colored prints help to hide any wet spots. When nursing on one side, press your forearm against the other side to prevent leaking.



> The most awkward moment is when your baby actually latches on. Turn your body away briefly. Or turn your head away for that moment, and it’s unlikely anyone will notice at all because they’ll be following your eyes, which are looking in another direction.



> A blanket or specially designed shawl or cover-up is much more attention-attracting than just nursing.



> Limiting nursing to very private situations can limit nursing, which limits your baby’s food. Another reason to nurse in public: we learn best by watching other mothers nurse, so by modeling successful breastfeeding, you may be teaching someone you never even notice how to breastfeed confidently.



> If you want to use a bottle because you’re going back to work, consider waiting until both you and your baby love breastfeeding and feel like old pros at it. There’s no magic window of opportunity, and this reduces the risk that bottles will take over.



> Having someone else give a bottle in order to participate in feeding misses a key point about breastfeeding. It’s a way to fill a stomach, yes, but it’s a relationship that only a mother and baby have. Partners are the ones who teach babies that there are relationships beyond breastfeeding—that love doesn’t always come with something to eat.



> Did you feel you needed time away from your partner when you were falling in love? No, you probably couldn’t be with each other enough. This is the falling-in-love stage with your baby, and togetherness is really important as you get to know each other.



> Babies often sleep through movies, and if they don’t, you can nurse in the dark without anyone noticing. You don’t have to leave your baby to get out of the house. Bring him with you and you’ll both have a better time.



> There’s a very, very wide range of normal experiences. And remember: the way things are now is NOT the way they’ll always be from now on.



> Everybody bends a little and everybody gets their basic needs met. The person who is the most dependent gets more of his or her needs met because he or she is less developed or less able to cope. “I’m far from a perfect mom, but breastfeeding my children and keeping them close those early years is something I did right, and it really worked.”



> You’ve likely become more confident about your milk production and have proudly watched your baby gain weight and flourish on your milk. Your baby has wakened to the world, too. Social smiles begin to come more and more frequently.



> Crying tends to peak around six to eight weeks,1 so you may find your baby seems inexplicably fussy at times, especially in the evenings.



> By now, you may have experienced growth spurts—fussier, needier times when your baby may nurse more than usual to build up your supply for a few days. Many mothers feel they occur somewhere around ten days, two weeks, three weeks, six weeks, and three months, but you can see from that frequency that the term is useful for explaining any fussy day to your aunt Franny. Nursing



> With some sensitive babies, this stage can be a bit more frustrating and challenging. Very distractible babies may let go or stop nursing every time they hear a new sound or catch some movement out of the corner of their eye.



> Sleeping through the night may result in a reduced milk supply and slowed weight gain. And sleeping for shorter periods and waking more frequently will keep your baby from spending too much time in deep sleep states, reducing his risk of SIDS.



> Around six weeks or so, though, some babies stop having the several bowel movements each day that are expected up until this point.2 Some start pooping once a day; some wait several days; some have a week or so of poop-free days.



> Some experts feel infrequent stooling can be a sign of digestive problems or allergies to something in the mother’s diet. Other experts think this is a normal variation since when they do finally poop, it is still very soft, not the hard stools you’d see in a constipated baby. What we do know is that this is not a reason to add formula, corn syrup, prune juice, or other foods to the baby’s diet.



> You might: Breastfeed your baby before you work out so that your breasts are less full. Wear a supportive bra to help you feel comfortable.



> Wear breast pads if leaking is still an issue. Take a quick shower or towel-dry before you nurse



> Many women lose around 1.75 pounds (0.8 kg) per month during the first six months of breastfeeding. Most of the rest of us find that we’re at least holding our own. A bonus is that during breastfeeding, we tend to lose weight from our hips and thighs—something we’re less able to do at other times.



> If your baby’s cord was cut before it stopped pulsing, he missed out on up to a third of his intended blood supply. That’s a lot of iron to lose.



> Traveling really makes you appreciate the ease of breastfeeding! And if your baby is accustomed to sleeping with you, she’ll feel at home wherever you go.



> Nuisance that it is, leaking does reduce your risk of plugged ducts from extra milk. You may need to wear breast pads and keep an extra pad on the bed for a little while longer.



> An actual schedule would only make things more complicated, and spacing out nursings to suit a clock jeopardizes your milk supply. So expect that while you can nudge your baby toward predictability, there will still be a certain amount of unpredictability.



> As one mother said, “We have a routine, but we don’t have a schedule. A schedule would mean he naps at three. A routine means we usually have a bath after supper.”



> Instead of medication, you could try an ice cube wrapped in a wet washcloth and secured with a strong rubber band, a frozen washcloth or teething toy, or any teething toy with lots of projections or holes. These teethers allow your still-awkward little one to be able to hold on to them anywhere and get something satisfying into her mouth.



> Since you’ve got it, you might as well flaunt it. It’s a sweet and special time in your life.



> Enjoy exploring the new pleasures of your new body, don’t rush, and keep your sense of humor intact.



> Babies do seem to have a sort of radar, however, and may wake up when you least expect—or want—them to. Your hand on his back may be all he needs to settle him back to sleep.



> Creativity, flexibility, and a strong sense of humor go a long way toward rekindling the physical side of your relationship while there’s a baby in the house. My



> LAM for short, is 98 to 99 percent effective (about the same as the pill) in preventing pregnancy when all three of the following are true: Your baby is under six months old AND Your periods haven’t resumed (before day fifty-six postpartum, bleeding, spotting, or vaginal discharge with some blood is not a period) AND Your baby is breastfeeding exclusively, without regularly receiving any other food or drink, including water



> Even having a job during those first six months that separates you from your baby for four or more hours a day reduces the effectiveness of LAM because pumping is not as effective as a baby at suppressing ovulation.



> Some babies nap frequently and easily; some resist sleep; some barely nap during the day but wake up only once at night. Basically, whatever your baby is doing is normal for him. Babies who are carried for much of the day usually sleep when they need to without fuss, dozing while their mothers move about.



> Rest assured that all these babies will sleep like logs as older children and will be nearly unrousable as teens, no matter what patterns you try to establish now. So do whatever is the least stressful for you and your baby, and don’t expect a schedule at this age. In fact, the least stressful approach right now may be sharing that nap when you can!



> As your baby learns to sit (around the middle of the first year), give him a place at the family table or some other regular access to solid food. At the right moment, he’ll reach for food (probably off your own plate), chew it, swallow it, and reach for more. That’s when solids start.



> When some babies start actively teething, their saliva seems to increase and even become more acidic. This can cause a rash on their face, on their bottom, or on your areola. Rinsing breast, bottom, and face a few times a day can help.



> First teeth may come before or after the six-month mark—some babies are born with teeth, some don’t get them until after their first birthday. That first tooth has an entry in almost every baby book.



> When a baby clamps, teeth or no teeth, she always gets her tongue out of the way first, or she’d bite herself. She can’t suck and bite at the same time, so as long as she’s actively nursing, you’re safe.



> My Baby Suddenly Stopped Nursing. Is It a Nursing Strike? True weaning happens gradually. An abrupt, unexpected end to nursing is almost certainly a “nursing strike.” Something in your baby’s world has caused his favorite activity to become scary or distressing; that’s not the same as his wanting to give it up for good.



> You’re helping out future nursing mothers by nursing in public. Every mother seen nursing makes it easier for the next one to do the same. And a private thumbs-up to other nursing mothers lets them know they have your support, too. Any



> This may be the easiest age for taking trips with your baby for a while. He’s not yet walking, which means his tolerance for sitting in a car or plane is still fairly high. He has enough interest in his surroundings that you can distract him for at least a bit when sitting begins to get tiresome.



> The Lactational Amenorrhea Method gives 98 to 99 percent pregnancy protection for the first six months, provided you’re nursing freely day and night without feeding other foods or liquids or using a pacifier regularly, and your periods haven’t returned. Protection remains extremely good during the next six months if your periods don’t return and if you don’t often go more than four hours between nursings during the day or six hours at night.



> And many women who have begun to have periods again have a few month of cycles that are too hormonally weak to support a pregnancy. But in general, once your periods return you can consider yourself fully fertile.



> Independence comes from feeling secure, and your role right now is to continue to provide that secure base, just as you have been. Some babies simply need a secure base longer. Wise parents have often said, “Meet the need, and the need goes away. Ignore the need, and the need remains.” Spoiling is still not a possibility at this age.



> Babies are built to fit into our busy days, not to be the center of them. Do your work. Clean house, run errands, fix your lunch, go places, and include your baby.



> It’s sometimes called “benign neglect”—a mother focusing on her own tasks, meeting her baby’s needs almost absentmindedly, but meeting them all the same. You can talk about how cold the frozen peas are, or carry him in the laundry basket, and never break stride. Your baby will probably love it.



> You can download the WHO charts at who.int/​childgrowth/​standards/chart_catalogue/en/index.html. They show that breastfed babies actually grow a little faster, on average, in the first three to four months and a little slower in the period from four to twelve months, compared to formula-fed babies.



> And a third reason may be that some people are honestly fearful that what we’re doing is harmful, often because they lack information about breastfeeding.



> Ask to hear their stories, in detail and without criticism from you. Sometimes a relative or friend will lose interest in your story after having a chance to tell his or hers. Offer information. Invite your mother or mother-in-law



> When someone asks about weaning, the response “We’re working on it” is true from the moment you start solids until whenever weaning is completed, maybe years later.



> Pick your battles. Sometimes you may just want to use a different room; other times it might make more sense to talk it through.



> Agree to differ: “I know this doesn’t fit with your own child-raising ideas. You can be sure we’re doing our best, and this is what’s working for us.” It’s your call: “We find that this works best for us.”



> His new mobility opens up a world of exploration. At the same time, his fine motor skills are improving. He can sit alone and play with toys. He can pick up tiny bits of food with his thumb and forefinger and pop them into his mouth.



> As the months go by, other foods become an increasingly important part of his total nutrition. That doesn’t mean your baby isn’t still getting many or most of his essential nutrients and immune factors from your milk.



> Just like introducing solids, it’s best to introduce these milks slowly to watch for allergic reactions.



> Fruit juices can be a treat at this age, but whole fruits are generally a better choice, since they provide more fiber and nutrients. If you do give juice, consider limiting it to between a quarter and a half cup each day, and possibly diluting it with water. Sipping juice off and on through the day can increase the risk of cavities.



> Sometime between nine and eighteen months is a common time for fertility to return, and ovulation can happen in the weeks before you see your first period. Your periods may be different from before: longer or shorter, or (if you’re lucky) trailing into view over a day or two rather than appearing out of the blue at public functions in full force.



> The American Academy of Pediatrics encourages nursing for at least a year, not weaning at a year; the Canadian Paediatric Society, the United Kingdom’s Department of Health, and the World Health Organization all encourage nursing for two or more years. A child who’s nearly one year old still doesn’t have a very effective digestive or immune system. While he can manage without human milk, he isn’t really designed to.



> Having a small, squeezable toy to hold might distract the child who likes to knead your other nipple. You’ll probably have to experiment to find an acceptable substitute. After a while, a child may bring his “fiddly” object to you when he wants to nurse!



> My Baby Is Scared of Strangers Smart baby! A baby’s fear of strangers seems to develop just about the time he becomes mobile. It makes sense. A babe in arms is automatically safe, because his mother knows what’s safe. But once he can crawl, he has to start making decisions for himself. The wise baby knows he isn’t very wise yet, and errs on the side of caution.



> Child development experts describe the mother as both the secure base from which a child dares to venture new things and the welcoming shore to which she returns from having adventured.



> Like all developmental stages, falling asleep on our own happens automatically in its proper time, no “training” needed. Before that time, most nursing mothers find that their child can fall asleep for someone else without nursing if Mom is out, but really needs to nurse if his mother is in the house.



> Dinnertime is tough—tired kids, tired parents. So make dinner in the morning and either use a slow cooker or put it in the fridge to reheat in the evening. Or cook in bulk once or twice a week.



> Whatever his reason, it can be a horrible embarrassment to discover that your child has taken to chomping on playmates. You can be sure that at this age it isn’t prompted by meanness, anger at you, or bully tendencies.



> Breastfeeding is less and less effective in preventing conception at this stage. So even if you haven’t had a period yet, pregnancy is a possibility.



> Of course, you can’t compare chimpanzees or gorillas directly to humans, but you can correlate weaning ages in these apes to certain biological markers: maturity of the immune system, molar eruption, adult size, and gestation. When Dr. Dettwyler looked at the ages at which those and other biological events occur in humans, she found the expected weaning range for humans was between two and a half and seven years.



> Even if your child is nursing fairly infrequently most of the time, expect it to increase if she gets sick. Often a sick toddler will drop all other foods and want to nurse around the clock. She doesn’t know it, but she’s maximizing the amount of antibodies and immune factors and helping to speed up her recovery.



> Bottom line: don’t expect your road through toddler nursing and on to weaning to be a straight line. Every child is different, and some ups and downs are to be expected.



> Many pregnant mothers (but certainly not all) also describe an antsy feeling that makes nursing anything from mildly unpleasant to downright annoying. This may be your body saying, One child at a time, please.



> They don’t mention that your baby doesn’t have a sleep problem. Your baby isn’t suffering from insomnia or sleep disorders. She’s just behaving the way babies around the world have behaved since time began.



> There are reasons for this. Our babies are born at an earlier stage of development than many other mammals. Human babies have really large, complex brains and their mothers have a pelvis that is narrow enough for walking on two legs.



> During that time, a baby relies totally on his mother to keep him stable and secure,1 day and night, just as she did during pregnancy. Without her, his heart rate, breathing, and temperature are less stable. Without her, he is more likely to enter deep sleep in a pattern that’s not normal or healthy for infants. He can manage without her, but it increases his stress level (which appears to impede his ability to manage stress later in life), and it slows his growth.



> Babies assigned to sleep in sidecars in those early days were more likely to be nursing at four months than babies sleeping completely separately, but less likely than babies in their mothers’ beds.



> But surely the mothers whose babies slept in bassinets got more sleep? Not according to the research! Babies in bassinets have to rouse and fuss more to get their mothers’ attention, which means they take longer to settle. Mothers have to sit up, hoist the baby out of the box, and lift the baby back into the box



> But mothers who have their babies in their beds actually get more total sleep than those who have their babies in another room, despite spending more time breastfeeding.



> Yes and no. A sidecar right next to your bed is better for breastfeeding than having your baby sleep across the room. Your baby can hear you moving and breathing, which is important; babies under about six months of age who are near enough to hear their mothers breathing and moving are less prone to sudden infant death syndrome because the sounds stimulate them to breathe.



> But keeping your baby close to you—in a crib in the same room, in a cradle or bassinet beside your bed, in a sidecar attachment to your bed, or actually in your bed—will make it far, far easier for you to be aware of your baby’s cues and to respond quickly to breastfeed through the night. It will also mean you get more sleep—you won’t have to wake up, walk down a hall, pick up the baby, sit up somewhere to feed him,



> If want your baby on a separate sleep surface, try nursing him on a small towel, pad, or receiving blanket. Once he’s asleep, pick him up, pad and all, and transfer both. The warm surface goes right along with him—no cold bedding and strange smell when you lay him elsewhere.



> Consider having your baby start his night wherever you are—living room, kitchen, wherever—and bring him to bed with you at your bedtime. You’ll probably end up nursing him more often … but it just might be the best thing you can do for his health.



> Having the baby sleep on his back is perhaps the single best protection against SIDS. That’s the position babies naturally assume when they sleep with their mothers. They



> One study showed that babies who routinely used a pacifier at night were more likely to die of SIDS on a night when they didn’t have the pacifier.



> The American Academy of Pediatrics now recommends that babies be kept in the parents’ room for at least the first six months—peak SIDS time—because it’s simply less safe to keep them elsewhere. Your sighs, rustlings, and even snoring are stimulating to your baby, helping to pull him out of any too-long or too-deep sleep.



> You may hear the advice that letting your baby fall asleep at the breast4 creates a “bad habit” because it sets up “undesirable sleep associations” that require you to be there for every nap and bedtime. That’s just not true. The natural design is that babies nurse, and often they fall asleep at the breast. You don’t “teach” them this, and it’s not a bad habit. It’s just normal. Instead,



> Babies tend to fall asleep when they have a full tummy, feel warm and secure, and feel tired. Breastfeeding provides the full tummy, warmth, and security, and it increases a baby’s sleep-inducing hormones! Falling asleep at the breast seems to be part of the basic plan.



> As children get older, this changes. A toddler understands that when you are out of the room you still exist. She can call you from her bed, and when you answer, “It’s okay, I’m just in the kitchen,” she is reassured by your voice and explanation.



> Babies who have just fallen asleep at the breast are usually in a lighter phase of sleep and are easily wakened. If you can hold your baby in your arms for a few more minutes after he drops off the breast and drops off to sleep, you’ll see him relax into a still-deeper sleep. At that point, being moved to another location is less likely to wake him up.



> Swaddling is intended to fool a baby into thinking he’s being held. With you nearby to pat him, cuddle him closer, and nurse him, he doesn’t need it.



> In the early days, you may find life easier if you keep a stack of diapers, some wipes, a wastebasket, maybe breast pads or a cloth diaper to tuck into a nightshirt and catch drips, and a change of clothes for both you and the baby at your bedside.



> Some mothers keep a couple of large bath towels handy, spreading a clean, dry surface as needed and dropping the damp one to the floor until morning.



> The main point is that the baby doesn’t care what you’re doing, so long as he feels safe and comfortable. Expect to be interrupted sometimes, though.



> Surprisingly, research finds that exclusively breastfeeding women who sleep with their babies get the most sleep of all, even though their babies wake more often. Why? There are probably several reasons in addition to the ones we covered earlier. Mothers who breastfeed exclusively are in a hormonal state that facilitates sleep.



> Nurse lying down or laid-back as much as possible. Even if you don’t sleep, being horizontal helps enormously.



> Getting outside with the baby for at least an hour or two every day really seems to make a difference in how well the baby sleeps at night. That fresh air and change of scenery is good for you, too.



> You can encourage them to change by offering to nurse more during the day (babies will often latch even if they are half asleep) and keeping them in the main living areas of your home so they’ll be stimulated by noise and activity.



> Some babies wake because of the unaccustomed stillness of night, after months of their mothers’ raucous heartbeat and stomach rumblings!



> Sleep training had its beginnings many decades ago, in an age when we thought Science and Schedules were the way to a trouble-free life. Little babies, of course, need their mothers’ presence not only for a sense of security and for physiological stability but also for food.



> This is why many mothers who train their babies to sleep through the night discover that they have milk supply issues down the road.



> When researchers tested this, they found that adding solid foods didn’t help babies sleep more5—in fact, for some it caused more night waking because of digestive problems or allergies.



> There is no evidence that nighttime nursing causes cavities.6 Other mammals with teeth nurse day and night, and they don’t get cavities.



> One reason is that human milk does not pool around the teeth during nursing; it is pulled instantly toward the throat and swallowed. Another is that cavity formation is inhibited by the lactoferrin, IgA, IgG, and high pH levels in human milk.



> The children whose teeth Palmer examined also ate a diet low in carbohydrates and processed sugar. Many research studies have shown that human milk does not cause cavities unless there is another carbohydrate source.



> The best way to avoid cavities is to wipe or brush your child’s teeth thoroughly at least twice a day.



> The World Health Organization: “Infants should be exclusively breastfed for the first six months of life to achieve optimal growth, development and health. Thereafter, to meet their evolving nutritional requirements, infants should receive nutritionally adequate and safe complementary foods while breastfeeding continues for up to two years of age or beyond.”



> Maybe you’re thinking that other foods would help your baby sleep through the night. Not according to the research. In fact, your baby might sleep less well because of the indigestion that too-early solids or formula can cause.



> “The more children I had, the less I did to start solids. As with toilet training and sleeping through the night, I learned that this was something that would accomplish itself when the child was ready.



> The same is true for your baby. His insides are designed to be ready for solid food once his outside has developed enough for him to eat it on his own. If he can’t pick up food, get it in his mouth, and chew it without choking, then he’s just not ready for solids, and his tummy probably isn’t ready, either. He’ll acquire all those on-the-outside skills by about six months. And that’s when his digestive tract is ready, too.



> The takeaway here is that it’s not necessary to do the job for her before she’s ready to do it herself!



> Why does a baby’s digestive tract need to be mature before he starts solids? Two words: allergies and enzymes. Allergies first: If a baby has anything besides your milk before the lining of his intestines becomes pretty well sealed against allergens (allergy producers) at around six months, some of those substances can slip through the intestinal walls into the bloodstream.



> Enzymes are what we use to break down foods for digestion, but babies aren’t born with the enzyme levels they’ll need as adults. Why should they be? They’re eating the most digestible food in the world—their mothers’ milk.



> Does your three-month-old baby suddenly seem much hungrier? Breastfed babies don’t need larger and larger amounts of milk for at least the first six months or so. Instead, their intestines become more efficient, their metabolism slows, and at around four months their rate of growth naturally slows.



> Suddenly your baby may want to nurse all the time and your breasts may feel constantly empty. But it’s not because you don’t have enough milk. It’s because your baby’s taking milk faster than you can make it. Your milk supply will gear up accordingly.



> Is your baby finished in five minutes where at first he took forty? That’s normal, too. Many babies get much more efficient at removing milk and don’t nurse as long when they’re older.



> Around four to five months, babies start noticing the big, bright world outside their mothers’ arms and suddenly can’t concentrate on nursing.



> To help your baby settle down and nurse during this stage, try breastfeeding in a soothing, darkened room, maybe lying down, either in silence or with quiet, relaxing music.



> Your baby can join the dinner table fun, even if she’s not quite ready for solids. Beginning whenever she can sit on her own, whether or not she’s truly ready for solids, you can bring her high chair up to the table next to you, or sit her on your lap at the table.



> And one of the cool things about waiting until she does it herself4 is that there’s usually much less mess, partly because she’s more skilled, and partly because she really wants to do it.



> If she does show signs of a reaction (rashes on her face or bottom, for instance), she may have a true sensitivity to a particular food. Just offer one kind of food every few days to find the culprit.



> You may be told to avoid fruits because they can make your child favor sweet foods. Don’t worry; nothing tastes sweeter than your milk!



> But they have tasted it! Formula always tastes the same, but your milk has always had faint echoes of whatever you eat, so these first tastes of family foods will probably seem familiar to your baby. In fact, research shows that formula-fed babies don’t accept new tastes as willingly.



> You can relax about this if you let your baby lead the way. There isn’t usually much impact on your milk supply at first, because most babies start by eating very little. “Servings” may be tiny5—one or two bites each. Over time, they take more and more solids, keeping your milk supply the same but increasing their total calories.



> First it’s your milk with solids for the joy of it; eventually it’s solids with your milk for the joy of it. And they do it all by themselves.



> To make sure your baby is getting as much of your milk as he needs when you’re beginning solids, it generally helps to nurse him before you both sit down to eat (if you get a chance). This will take the edge off his hunger and put him in a better mood for the meal.



> We’ve grown accustomed to much more salt than we need. Leave the salt off when you fix your baby’s food.



> Fresh foods are usually better than frozen, and frozen foods are preferable to canned. By concentrating on unprocessed foods, you and you your baby will get all the known nutrients in their natural proportions.



> Chewing for your baby is probably as old as humanity, and many of us have used it to make a less appropriate food more baby-worthy. It even adds some digestive enzymes. Is there any harm in it?



> “If dinner was potentially staining (tomato sauce), we let the kids eat topless. Bath time immediately followed dinner if necessary.”



> Research indicates that a family dinner is linked to improved children’s grades, reduced risk of obesity, and even reduced risk of substance abuse in the years ahead.



> Directed feeding, whether it’s “clean your plate” or preventing exploration and self-feeding, may not be in a child’s long-term best interests.



> You’ve given your baby an excellent start toward a healthy diet by following his appetite cues during breastfeeding. A little mess as he learns the textures, tastes, and delights of solid foods is just another part of that healthy start.



> Each mammal’s milk gives clues about how often those mothers and babies need to be together. Some, like rabbits and bats, make milk that’s very high in fat and protein. They feed their babies, hide them away, and go off for the day (or night) to find food while the babies slowly digest their milk.



> Human milk isn’t designed for that kind of mothering. Because our milk is relatively low in fat and protein, our babies need to refuel often. And our breasts are designed so that they need to be emptied often while the baby is small or they start to get uncomfortably full and milk production drops.



> Knowing that your baby is drinking your milk helps you take care of him even when you’re apart. And at the end of a long workday, breastfeeding provides the most normal, secure way for your child to grow into his expanding and sometimes scary world. It



> A big question is when to start maternity leave. Research shows that having a longer leave1 after the baby is born increases breastfeeding success. But research also shows that women who start their leave a few weeks before the baby’s birth are less likely to have a Cesarean section or other complications.



> You might be lucky enough to have family members who can help out, or an on-site day care at work. Maybe you and your partner can work partly or fully from home, or work different shifts, to minimize the time your baby spends in outside care.



> If you don’t have a family member to help or a day care option at work, consider finding a place closer to work than to home. That will mean a shorter period of time away from your baby.



> Breastfeeding works best when babies are fed in response to their cues, of course. But most day care providers use a schedule, and some are more rigid than others. Asking for a more flexible approach can feel uncomfortable; it may help to remember that you’re being an advocate for your child.



> To minimize your baby’s stress, look for a place that has: A low staff turnover, so that your child isn’t constantly exposed to newcomers. A low child-to-staff ratio. (In some places, five infants to one caregiver is the maximum allowed;



> Minimal structure. Even though “day care as enrichment and education” is a popular concept, babies and small children need love and focused adult attention, not education. A setting that will store, use, and respect your milk. Caregivers who are warm and affectionate, not rushed and rigid. A setting that allows older children time outside.



> Already having a stash of stored milk helps. Expressing more milk than your baby needs will really get your milk supply built up, too, so that you’ll have a cushion to fall back on—an insurance policy in case of difficulties.



> The easiest way to do this is to pump once or twice a day right after your baby nurses, beginning a few weeks before you start work or once you feel breastfeeding is running smoothly for both of you, and freezing whatever milk you pump.



> You’re pumping in addition to feeding, so there’s not likely to be much left over. At first you’re just telling your body to make more. You should begin to see the results in a couple of days. And when you’re pumping at work instead of breastfeeding, you’ll get even more.



> Using small containers until you have a better feel for how much your baby needs means the sitter won’t be throwing out any unused “liquid gold.”



> A freezer well stocked with extra milk makes your days much less stressed.



> One idea is to put the pump near where you often nurse, and do a few minutes of pumping after several nursings each day. Another approach is to put the pump someplace that you pass often, and do just a few minutes’ pumping whenever you go by. You can let the equipment and milk stand, with a towel over them, and store the milk and clean the parts twice a day.



> Here’s a workday approach that works for many: Nurse first thing in the morning, with another short nursing right before leaving the house or at day care. If you have time, express for a few minutes as soon as you get to work.



> The next chances to express are usually mid-morning, lunch, and mid-afternoon. Nurse your baby when you pick him up before you leave day care, and then whenever he likes in the evening and again before bedtime.



> Nurse at least once during the night, too, if he wakes up for it. (And he almost certainly will, at least at first, because he’s been missing you and wants to reconnect.) Night nursing can help you maintain your milk production and gives you extra time with your baby.



> It’s important to make sure that you breastfeed as much as you can when you’re with your baby. Your nursing relationship is founded on your baby nursing, not bottle-feeding, and you both need that time together.



> So even though you may have bottles of your milk ready to go in the refrigerator, it can create problems if you have someone else give one to the baby while you make dinner or take care of something else. Your baby needs you and you need your baby.



> “Pumping actually was helpful for my work in many ways. It gave me a much-needed break, and I often read articles and information I wouldn’t normally have read during work hours.



> Reduce your hours or job-share.



> Work the same number of hours but on a more flexible schedule.



> Do some or all of your work at home. The Internet and other electronic connections have opened up work-at-home possibilities for many women.



> Bring your baby with you. Jennifer



> You just need to clear the use of a clean and private place a few times each day. You’ll also need to make sure it’s okay to take a couple of twenty-minute breaks each day (this is about the same amount of time most smokers take) in addition to your lunch break (which could be another opportunity to pump).



> It’s to your boss’s advantage to have you breastfeed. You’re likely to need more days off work if you fed formula. Your own health risks are increased by formula-feeding, too. Studies have shown that breastfeeding mothers—and other employees—feel more positive about companies that support them in continuing to breastfeed.



> A refrigerator, or an insulated thermos or cooler with ice packs, will keep your milk consistently cold at work. If you have a standard workweek, you can even give that day’s milk directly to the sitter for the next day when you pick your baby up, so she can use it the following day. Milk pumped on Friday can be stored in the refrigerator for use on Monday.



> First of all, there’s no magic window of opportunity for starting. Just wait until breastfeeding is well established and going smoothly for both you and the baby. It generally makes sense to start offering a bottle about two weeks before you have to go back to work or school.



> Offer the bottle as just one more interesting thing, when the baby isn’t really hungry.



> Offer the bottle when he’s really sleepy, either just waking up or just drifting off, when he’s running more on instinct than on intellect.



> Offer a plain cup or sippy cup. Nobody said milk has to come from a bottle!



> Make Bottle-Feeding More Like Nursing Warm the milk (but not in a microwave, which can create hot spots). Hold the baby close, mimicking a nursing position. Use lots of cuddling and cooing.



> Offer the bottle tucked underneath an adult arm so the baby feeds from it in a breastfeeding position, with the bottle nipple very close to where your nipple would be.



> Use “newborn” or “slow flow” bottle nipples to slow down the flow. Offer a pacifier if he’s well fed but still needing to suck. Never cut the nipple opening to speed up the feeding.



> isn’t always easy to tell how a baby is doing; the baby who seems quiet and content in the child care center may actually have higher levels of stress hormones than the one who cries and protests.



> Take the time to help your baby get to know your caregiver before you begin leaving him. If it is a day care center, try to spend some time—maybe a week or two—there with your baby before you start work, so that it is a familiar place when he’s first left there without you. Leave some items with your baby that have your comforting scent on them—a T-shirt you have slept in, maybe. Try to arrive at the day care early enough to be there for a while and help make the transition a smooth one.



> Babies sometimes protest being picked up as much as they do being dropped off at day care. Be patient with this, and take some time to help your baby through the transition.



> Don’t be surprised if your baby starts waking up more at night, even if he or she has been sleeping longer stretches before you returned to work. Many babies realize that during the night you’re at home, and they naturally want to be with you then.



> Keeping your baby close to you at night (in your bed, in a co-sleeper arrangement attached to your bed, or in a crib set up right next to your bed) will make your nights easier.



> Consider using a sling or soft carrier when you and your baby are together. It will allow you to get some housework and cooking done while keeping your baby reassured and comforted by your presence.



> In the future, when you have the time, money, and energy, do what you can to support legislation that supports mothers and children, so that our daughters aren’t faced with our dilemmas.

> It’s okay to change your mind about going back and decide to stay home with your baby. And there may come a time down the road when you change your mind again and return to work or begin a new career. A lot of motherhood in the years ahead is going to be about changing your mind to fit your changing world and your family’s changing needs.



> “And as I sit, I hold on tightly to two things I know are true: no one can do this job like I can, and this time will never come again. There will be morning coffees and new offices and important-sounding challenges in my future. But never again will my baby be seven months old with his first-ever flu, and never again will he and I sit on the floor sharing his first sneeze-inflicted giggle.



> You can take time away from your career for now and go back in a few years when the kids are older. Even in today’s fast-paced world, where technology changes so rapidly, there are often ways to stay involved in your field while still spending most of your time with your children.



> “When you have a commitment to do the best for your child, you explore what you never before thought you would consider in life. My professional social work career, though I loved it and was extremely good at it, was no longer serving my family and the lifestyle we wanted.

> happen only now. And it takes time. There are not very many mothers who really feel on top of their role before about six weeks after the birth.



> What you wear will affect how easily—and where—you can breastfeed when you bring your baby along.



> Sometimes after a separation of more than a day, a baby will refuse to nurse and even seem to reject his mother. He didn’t know where you’d gone, his trust in you has been bruised, and he’s letting you know he’s not happy about it. Most of these breast refusals are temporary.



> Regardless of your reason for expressing milk,1 it’s probably going to be a three-part process: Milk Out (of your breasts), Milk Stored (until your baby receives it), and Milk In (to your baby).



> When you can’t be with your baby, expressing milk not only provides food for him but also keeps your milk production going.



> At the very least, it’s worth learning the techniques because there are times when almost every mother wants to express a little milk, like those nights when the baby sleeps extra long.



> Begin by “waking up your breasts” with a combination of breast massage, breast shaking, and nipple tugs or rolls.



> Jane Morton, MD, a pediatrician, researcher, and professor in California, teaches a technique that is easy to remember: Press, Compress, Release:



> A pump has advantages over hand expression in some circumstances. There’s very little to learn, you can multi-task, and you needn’t focus on what you’re doing.



> Each user must purchase a personal kit of parts (tubing, flanges, valves, etc.) to attach to the motor. You can express milk from both breasts at the same time with no loss of suction or speed, which saves time and usually stimulates better milk production.



> If you’re looking for a working mother’s pump, steer clear of inexpensive electric or battery-operated “discount store” quality pumps. They just don’t have the power to combine suction and cycling in a way that will remove milk adequately several times a day, week after week.



> When they start to wear out, they don’t just suddenly stop working. The suction and cycling mechanisms veeerrrry slowly break down, and eventually you realize you aren’t pumping as much milk and the suction doesn’t feel as strong



> If you don’t already have a nipple injury that’s causing pain, the most likely problem is a mismatch between the size of the breast flanges (also called breast shields) and your breasts. The flanges are the funnel-shaped pieces that touch your breasts. Friction from a too-small flange can lead to pain and swelling on the nipple and areola, and can even abrade the skin after a while.



> To know if you’re using the right size flange for your nipples, you can take a look at what happens to your nipple and areola when you pump. You should see the nipple moving easily in the tunnel, pulling your areola slightly with it. Look at your nipple immediately after you pump.



> If you’re expressing your milk instead of nursing and your baby is only a few days old, it’s best to put in eight to twelve pumping sessions each day3 (with at least one of them during the night) for the first few weeks to establish a full milk supply.



> Aim for ten, work for eight, never go under six. Don’t think “every three hours” or you won’t get eight in. Three hours will stretch to three and a half, and by the end of the day you’ve done five, with no way to catch up. Instead, think—and do—eight. Cluster-pump. Don’t worry about evenly spacing the sessions—babies don’t!



> Remember that we make milk the fastest when our breasts are the emptiest, and that the back pressure of unremoved milk can slow the rate and drop the amount we produce.



> Don’t watch the clock to know when you’re pumping session is over—feel your breasts to see if they’re lighter and softer.



> Unless you’re pumping for a premature or ill baby, just rinse the flanges and set them aside for the next pumping, washing them up at the end of the day.



> Many women get their double-pumping routine down to a total of ten minutes, including setup and cleanup. But it does take practice and learning your body’s quirks.



> Most moms pump after breastfeeding, to get milk that the baby leaves. If your baby is not removing milk efficiently or nursing long enough, pumping at this time can be really important in order to drain your breasts thoroughly and keep up your supply.



> If your baby is nursing well, you may not get very much when you pump after a feeding, but that’s okay—you’re telling your breasts to make more milk. If your supply is low, your baby may be too unsettled after nursing for you to pump.



> Use lower suction overall. A pump provides the most milk when it’s set at the upper end of fully comfortable. That is not the same as uncomfortable!



> Your fresh milk is not the same as cow milk, goat milk, or formula. It has living cells in it that actively fight pathogens. Even frozen, human milk has all the nutritional properties babies need and, depending on the length of time it’s been frozen, it still offers anti-infective qualities that no formula or other milk product can beat.



> Milk to be given later to healthy full-term babies can be expressed into any clean container, but most mothers use either bottles or disposable bags made just for human milk collection and freezing.



> To save your sanity, you can put the date on the bag or bottle that you pump your milk into. If your baby goes to day care, you’ll probably also need to write your baby’s name on the label.



> Refrigerated milk has more anti-infective properties than frozen milk. And milk that has been frozen for two weeks has more anti-infective properties than milk that has been frozen for two months. It’s best to refrigerate or chill your milk right after expressing it if it can’t be given to your baby in the next few hours. But remember that even long-frozen milk is far superior to formula. For



> Your milk will stay fresh for at least four to eight hours at room temperature, approximately 77°F (22°C). The hotter the day, the shorter the time, but there’s no need to jump right out of your seat to put it in the fridge, assuming you have a healthy, full-term baby. If



> If the baby doesn’t finish the bottle, it can be refrigerated promptly and given to him at his next feeding. There’s usually some backwash of bacteria from his saliva in the bottle, which reduces the number of hours a partly used container can sit out unrefrigerated.



> You can combine the milk from several pumping sessions in one container as long as you chill the newly expressed milk separately before you put it into the container, so that you’re adding cold to cold.



> The best way to warm your chilled milk before serving it to your baby is to hold the container under warm running water for several minutes. Or immerse the container in a pan of water that has been heated—though not truly hot—on the stove. Don’t heat the milk directly on the stove because it can get too hot. And don’t use a microwave because it can cause hot spots in the milk,



> Don’t worry if the milk has separated into two layers during its time in the refrigerator. This is normal. All freshly expressed milk separates, even fresh cow milk



> The top layer is the cream and the lower is the whey. Just swirl it gently to redistribute the cream before giving it to baby.



> Also, don’t worry about the color of your milk. It can change after you eat certain foods, but that doesn’t harm the milk at all. Just tell yourself, “If I were nursing, I wouldn’t be seeing this!”



> In fact, you might find it makes the most sense to fill each container with only 2 ounces (60 ml) of milk. Two to 4 ounces (60 to 120 ml) is what your baby is likely to want in a single feeding, so less of your precious milk is likely to be wasted if you collect it in these amounts.



> If you have the awful luck to have a power outage or freezer failure, your milk is probably okay for up to two days if the freezer is full of food or one day if it is half full (grouping foods together will help them stay frozen longer).



> Previously frozen milk that has been thawed can be kept in the refrigerator for up to twenty-four hours. If it hasn’t been used by that time, it should be discarded or refrozen. DO



> Washing them thoroughly with hot, soapy water is usually all they need. If you have a dishwasher, run the pump flange and connector and bottles through it whenever it’s convenient.



> More than one mother of a healthy, full-term baby has used the sniff test on her milk to see if it’s still fresh.



> The sniff test doesn’t detect germs, but can tell you if milk has soured, which is, of course, the result of germs (as opposed to a soapy smell, which is the result of lipase). And more than one mother has tasted her milk as well.



> Putting your milk along with some frozen ice packs in a small cooler or insulated bag should get you where you’re going.



> I made up my mind to breastfeed for six months. But by the time David was six months old, everything was going so smoothly that it seemed a pity to quit—and I didn’t want to have to go out and buy formula. Maybe I’d keep going for another three months. At nine months, he was enthusiastically eating solids but still nursing quite often, and again weaning seemed like more trouble than it was worth.



> From the first time your baby eats or drinks something other than your milk—maybe even from the first time your baby sucks on something other than your breast—the weaning process has begun. It ends the last time your child nurses. And that means weaning can take several days, weeks, months, or years.



> If given the opportunity, most babies will breastfeed until they naturally outgrow the need, which appears to be sometime between two and a half and seven years.



> But personality differences aside, research indicates that the opposite is true: children who are not nursed past infancy tend to be somewhat less secure and less independent than their peers who breastfed longer.



> The hormones and enzymes that are released by nursing help gentle a child into sleep. Traveling is more complicated if bottles and formula and a special teddy or blanket replace the simplicity of breastfeeding.



> In their book Facts for Life, UNICEF, UNESCO, and the World Health Organization state, “Babies fall ill frequently as they begin to crawl, walk, play, drink and eat foods other than breastmilk. A sick child needs plenty of breastmilk. Breastmilk is a nutritious, easily digestible food when a child loses appetite for other foods. Breastfeeding can comfort a child who is upset.”



> At some point, he begins to take more solids and nurse less often than he used to. His diapers aren’t as much fun to change, because his stools are, well, pretty adult. Then he gets a cold and ramps up the nursing. The increased milk makes his stools looser and maybe even yellow again.



> Children naturally have a tremendous desire to move on to the next stage of development: once they can walk they stop crawling. As the wider world opens up to them, they gradually close the door on babyhood. So even if you never lift a finger, even if you never ever ask him to wait, Your Child Will Wean, just as surely as his teeth will come in. Doing nothing works just fine.



> Remember that early weaning will leave you without the single most effective mothering tool you will ever have: an easy way to calm and settle your child.



> Tantrums and illness may increase as a result of weaning. Sleep times—your child’s and yours—may be more problematic. Weaning doesn’t make your child need you less; it just gives you one less tool to use to meet his needs.



> If he’s under a year old, you will be dealing with the expense and bother of mixing, heating, feeding, and cleaning several bottles of formula a day. When you go out, you’ll have to be sure to take enough bottles, formula, and water with you for the length of time you’ll be away, and then carry the used, often smelly bottles around until you get back home.



> Read books in five-minute spurts. Or listen to one on a podcast or CD while you nurse the baby to sleep or wash dishes. Record your favorite TV show, and watch it a few minutes at a time.



> If you’ve really reached the end of your rope and you’ve decided that you just can’t do it anymore, you know what’s right for you. That’s how good parenting works. Sometimes you can’t find enough information and support to fix the problems. Give yourself a truly warm hug for your efforts



> There may be cases in which it’s important to wean in order to maintain a pregnancy, but they’re extremely rare. The concern is that the oxytocin released with nursing will stimulate uterine contractions and start labor prematurely.



> After all, even extreme happiness causes oxytocin release. We’re designed so that our uterus can’t detect oxytocin well (because it doesn’t develop many oxytocin receptors) until hours before the baby is born.



> The World Health Organization’s review of the research finds that it takes a good two years for a woman’s body to recover fully from pregnancy and childbirth, and for mother and the current baby both to be ready for a new pregnancy; survival rates for both are greater with more than two years between children.



> If your periods haven’t returned and you want to get pregnant soon, you could consider night weaning, not pumping during the day, or just generally cutting back, to see if that starts them up. Often a break of six hours on one or several nights is enough to kick-start fertility.



> There are6 very few medications that don’t work with breastfeeding. The main exceptions are certain radioactive drugs, chemotherapy, and a very few long-lasting drugs.



> If you’re not ready to stop, don’t feel you have to. Telling them that you truly appreciate their concern and that you know they’re saying this because they care tends to defuse the tension; people like to think you see them positively.



> “Triple Nipple Syndrome”: breast, pacifier, and bottle.7 If a baby has learned that a breast is just food and a pacifier or a bottle is for comfort, he can decide that it’s not worth the bother of negotiating for the breast.8 Even babies who aren’t given alternative sucking sources may wean early if breastfeeding is offered reluctantly or according to a schedule.



> If You Breastfeed Your Baby for Just a Few Days … he will have received your colostrum, or early milk—his first and easiest “immunization” that also gets his digestive system working smoothly. Breastfeeding is how your baby is built to start life, and it helps your uterus recover from the birth.



> If You Breastfeed Your Baby for Four to Six Weeks … you will have eased your baby through the most hazardous part of his infancy. Newborns who are not breastfed are much more likely to get sick or be hospitalized, and have many more digestive problems than breastfed babies.



> If You Start Weaning at Three or Four Months … her digestive system will have matured a great deal, and she will be much better able to tolerate all the foreign substances in formula.



> If there is a family history of allergies, though, you’ll greatly reduce her risk by waiting a few more months before adding anything at all to her diet of your milk. If You Breastfeed Your Baby for Six Months … without adding any other food or drink, your baby will be much less likely to suffer an allergic reaction to formula or other foods.



> If You Breastfeed Your Baby for Nine Months … he’ll have the food he’s designed for—your milk—through the fastest and most important brain and body development of his life.



> If You Begin Weaning Your Baby at a Year … you can avoid the expense and bother of formula. Your child’s one-year-old body can probably handle most of the table foods your family enjoys.



> Weaning cold turkey can be upsetting to both your baby and your breasts.



> The first formula you try might not agree with your baby, so it may take some trial and error. It’s a good idea to pump for any dropped feedings during the first week or so, while you make sure your baby can tolerate formula.



> Some babies who can’t tolerate formula at first can be eased into it over time, or can tolerate it better if it’s tried again a few weeks later. In the meantime, keeping your supply up lets you swing right back into nursing if need be.



> Then add another bottle for a day or two, gradually increasing the number of bottle-feedings and decreasing the number of breastfeedings. The last nursings to go are usually first thing in the morning, naptime, and bedtime.



> The whole process could take two weeks or more. Since breastfeeding means more than just food, your baby may not bottle-feed as often as he breastfed. It’s important to make up for the comfort feedings by giving more cuddles, snuggles, and attention.



> The United States and United Kingdom recommend human milk or formula rather than cow milk for the entire first year.



> Formula causes tiny intestinal bleeds in many children, which compromise their iron stores. But children need a good iron source throughout their first year. If they’ve lost iron through long-term formula-feeding, they need a better iron source than cow milk for those last three months. Weaning



> It may take a week to ten days to feel like you don’t have to remove any more milk, and you may be able to express drops of milk for a year or more, but eventually your breasts will stop making milk completely.



> Unfortunately, that’s why some parents resort to letting the baby “cry it out.” Their goal is for the baby to find her own way to get back to sleep without any help from the parents. But research has shown that this is very stressful for babies.



> Eventually children do start sleeping for longer periods at night, although some night waking is still normal through the preschool years. Making sure that your child eats and drinks enough through the day and has plenty of exercise may help him sleep as much as he is physically and developmentally ready for.



> Many women can tell you vividly about their breastfeeding experiences, even when they’re elderly. Weaning is an important transition—really the end of a process that began at conception—and the end of a unique intimacy.



> For the rest of your life, you will say, ‘Yes, that’s where I was supposed to go. That’s what I had planned.’ And the pain of that will never, ever, ever, ever go away, because the loss of that dream is a very, very significant loss. But if you spend your life mourning the fact that you didn’t get to Italy, you may never be free to enjoy the very special, the very lovely things about Holland.”



> As Diana knows from her personal experience, exclusive pumping is very different from breastfeeding even though both involve lactation. Breastfeeding is child-driven, happening when the baby is hungry or thirsty, or just wants to nurse for comfort.



> Since pumping is mother-driven, it’s likely to happen on a more consistent schedule that revolves around her daily routines. Consistency is definitely good, but it lacks the many little top-offs that really help keep milk production strong.



> If you started out exclusively pumping from the beginning or the early weeks, it can be useful to pump more frequently at first. A newborn generally nurses at least eight to twelve times in twenty-four hours. One approach is to aim for ten expressions per day; not to fall below eight.



> Keep in mind that milk is made most quickly when the breast is least full; the fuller your breasts are, the slower milk is being made. If you let them get too full for too long, milk production will slow down dramatically.



> One way to know for sure if overfeeding is the problem is weight gain. So long as he is gaining appropriately, then all is well. But if you’ve ruled out overfeeding, then you may need to take some steps to increase your production.



> Human milk is digested more quickly than formula, so an exclusively human-milk-fed baby is likely to need to be fed more frequently than a formula-fed baby. Just because he’s being bottle-fed doesn’t mean he can’t be fed on demand.



> We encourage you to spend as much time as you possibly can with your baby skin to skin on your chest. The transition from Isolette to you or you to Isolette can be difficult for premies; it’s easier on your baby if your stays are at least a couple of hours long.



> Kangaroo Care When you hold your baby skin-to-skin for long stretches of time, research has shown: Your baby’s oxygenation levels and breathing rates are more regular and stable, in harmony with his heart rate. His heart rate is slightly higher, showing a positive response to being close to you. You have the ability to warm and stabilize your baby’s temperature better than an incubator,



> He is more likely to breastfeed more easily, and your milk production increases.



> He will have a better immune system, with less vulnerability



> You will feel closer to your baby—a help in healing the trauma of the premature birth. There are no downsides.



> Kangaroo Mother Care changes the arrangement. The mother acts as the primary caregiver, wearing the baby in a special wrap nearly twenty-four hours a day, and the hospital provides backup care and expertise as needed.



> Frequent pumping is important to build your milk supply. Your future milk production is based on the amount of milk removed in these early days. If you pump less now, there will be less milk six weeks down the road.



> It’s better to overproduce in the beginning so you’ll have enough later, when your baby catches up. Remember to do a little hand expression after you pump during these early weeks; it could make a real difference for your overall supply.



> If you are doing Kangaroo Care, you may find that at some point your baby starts moving down your body and heading for your breast. He may even latch on without much help from you. This is an excellent sign that your baby is developmentally ready to breastfeed.



> Expect to feel a bit anxious and nervous the first time your baby breastfeeds. He probably still seems impossibly tiny! Try a laid-back nursing position first. If you’ve been doing Kangaroo Care, you’ve likely been in this position many times: get comfortable semi-reclining, with some pillows to keep you comfortable, and relax with baby tummy down on your chest.



> A baby born between thirty-six and thirty-nine weeks may not be technically premature. But they often seem to have some immaturity and need extra help in the first several weeks to get the hang of breastfeeding.



> Here are some ideas that may help your near-term baby breastfeed4 more easily: Minimize stimulation: lights down, TV off, voices quiet, less handling.



> Keep your baby skin to skin to keep him warm and secure. Until he reaches his due date, wake him for feedings if he sleeps longer than three hours.



> Consider the laid-back breastfeeding position to give your baby stability and support during feedings. If you sit up, try using your hand cupped under his chin while nursing to support his chin and cheeks.



> Take baths together, lounge around in bed together, co-sleep. Keep your breasts a comforting place to be so she has positive associations with them. Laid-back nursing positions can also be really helpful while you encourage your baby to nurse.



> Unfortunately, breastfeeding during chemotherapy is not safe because the chemotherapy drugs are incredibly toxic and do transfer into your milk. Pumping to whatever extent you would like is an option, maintaining a toehold on a milk supply until your chemotherapy is completely over, and then relactating to whatever extent you choose.



> Sometimes women are worried that removing milk to ease their discomfort will only encourage more milk to be made, but it’s actually the best thing to do to stay comfortable and prevent a breast infection. The point is to remove just enough to be comfortable, but not enough to drain your breasts well.



> If you want to minimize the alcohol your baby gets, try nursing right before you have a drink—your milk will be alcohol-free again within two or three hours.



> Make the plug smaller. Soak a cotton ball in vinegar and wear it over your nipple inside a bra. Milk has a lot of calcium in it, and vinegar dissolves calcium deposits.



> Make the nipple pore softer. Soak in the tub or shower, then soak a cotton ball in water, olive oil, or canola oil (corn or peanut oil could encourage allergies) and wear it in your bra over your nipple.



> The blood may not be in your milk at all. Sometimes a crack in a damaged nipple opens up and bleeds as the baby sucks; taking care of the nipple will stop the bleeding.



> The lumps will shift location and change, getting larger and smaller as your breast empties and fills. Lumps that come and go are not a cause for any concern. If there’s a particular lump that is persistently there, it may require some investigation.



> The reverse is truly remarkable. If your baby picks up an illness that you haven’t been exposed to, she passes those germs to you through nursing, and within the breast itself you begin making antibodies and passing them back.



> There are very few illnesses that require any kind of mother/baby or baby/milk separation. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (cdc.gov) and the World Health Organization (who.int/eng) both have information on breastfeeding during specific maternal diseases and vaccinations. Bottom line: with very few exceptions, keep nursing!



> If you are vomiting and/or have diarrhea, you might see a small dip in your milk production. Drink enough to stay hydrated, and know that your milk will increase as you recover. Most medications that you might need are compatible with breastfeeding.



> Colic is the catchall description when a baby cries hard at least three hours a day, usually late in the day, for unknown reasons. It tends to start in the early weeks and is usually gone by about four months.



> Some colic is probably caused by oversupply, which has its own section in this chapter. Some is probably caused by reflux, which also has its own section. Both oversupply and reflux are much more likely to be a problem when meals are large and widely spaced, and reflux is worse when the baby lies down.



> Babies who are carried most of the day not only have the reassurance of their mothers but also tend to have small, frequent meals and stay upright much of the time, all of which help with reflux and oversupply, and may make colic better.



> Many fussy babies settle down when they’re allowed free access to their mother’s body and breasts.



> Remember the phrase “contact, carry, walk, and talk.” Research indicates that these steps, used in sequence as needed, can significantly reduce crying in many babies.



> Respond right away. Research shows that responding before the baby gets worked up allows you to calm him more easily. Use a soft carrier as much as possible, so that your baby is close to your body, upright, and easily fed.



> Your baby isn’t doing this to drive you crazy, and his crying doesn’t mean you’re doing something wrong. This time is even more unhappy for him than it is for you. He needs you now more than ever. Having a baby with colic is tough, but it does end.



> Engorgement is too much fluid in a breast. In the first week after birth, it’s a combination of milk and increased circulation. Engorged breasts feel heavy, full, tender or painful, hot. Over-fullness can make latching difficult.



> She might spit up much more than normal, have green stools on occasion, have a lot of gas that may smell more than usual, and may have a rash on her cheeks or bottom. She may develop eczema as well. And you may start to notice a link between things you eat and these changes in your baby. The



> What you’re seeing might be a food sensitivity or a true food allergy. When your baby is small, her intestines allow particles into her system more readily, and in some babies certain foods passed on through the milk can cause some of the reactions you see.



> Most mothers start by trying to eliminate some of the foods most likely to cause a reaction. These seem to be: Cow milk



> Soy products,



> Eggs.



> Citrus fruits and juices. Wheat and wheat flours. Corn.



> Caffeine in foods such as coffee, tea, and cola drinks.



> Chocolate



> Or try a rotation diet. If you eat a particular food (say, cheese) on Monday, you don’t eat anything with dairy in it on Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday. Then you can have dairy again on Friday.



> As you follow this diet, track your baby’s symptoms, trying new combinations and noting when she seems most fussy.



> Keeping your baby with you, his skin against your skin, with a blanket over you both, is the best prevention for hypothermia. Being snuggled toasty warm in bed with you is also a good way to prevent



> Premature or ill babies are more at risk from building up too much bilirubin than healthy, full-term babies are. The jaundice that can occur from not having enough bowel movements tends to be fading by about five days of age, as milk becomes more plentiful, so jaundice that persists beyond then may be a case of so-called breastmilk jaundice. Don’t



> By far the most common causes of poor weight gain are babies who are not nursing often enough or not nursing well enough. Weight gain can begin to spiral down as a result, and a little tweaking turns everything around. So your first step might be offering the breast more often and rereading



> Avoid herbs that can decrease your supply, such as parsley, sage, and peppermint (in large quantities), and medications such as pseudoephedrine, hormonal birth control (especially when introduced before four months postpartum), bromocriptine, ergotamine, and Methergine.



> The basics for mastitis treatment are simple: Empty Breast, Lots of Rest. Empty Breast means plenty of nursing or milk expression. Try to keep that side nice and soft without neglecting the other side. Since this is inflammation, cold may be helpful.



> Lots of rest means don’t stand if you can sit, don’t sit if you can lie down, don’t try to stay awake if you can sleep. Feet up as much as possible. Favorite books, magazines, music, TV, or movies. A pitcher of juice or water nearby. A stack of diapers, a plateful of easy snacks (that you didn’t fix, if possible), a comfy pillow. You’re sick. You’ll get better much faster if you behave that way! Diane



> The cause can be physical—a stuffy nose or earache, for instance—or emotional. Maybe there’s been a move or new job; maybe you startled him when he bit you; maybe a loud noise startled him while he was nursing. A change in lotion, perfume, deodorant, or detergent; a low supply or change in milk taste; contact or negotiated nursings; or too many bottles or pacifiers may contribute to a strike.



> And even if the original problem is resolved, your baby still may not want to nurse. It’s as though he doesn’t realize that it was his stuffy nose that made breastfeeding uncomfortable—he thinks that breastfeeding itself caused the difficulties and he’s reluctant to try it again.



> If the strike continues for more than a day, you could offer your expressed milk in a cup—but avoid giving bottles if you can so that his sucking urge will encourage him toward breastfeeding.



> Nurse the baby in his sleep.



> Sing or rock your baby with your shirt open



> Nurse somewhere different—while walking around,



> Offer in a whole new position—



> Do a dance or baby bounce



> Don’t offer for a day or so,



> the baby hasn’t nursed for a couple of hours and the milk has had time to collect in the ducts, he’ll drink the lower-fat milk first, then the fat level will rise as the baby’s continued sucking helps to bring down more of the fat.



> Consider removing the following one step at a time from both your and your baby’s diet, not moving to the next step unless the first step doesn’t appear to be enough: Dairy and soy products Artificial colors and preservatives Anything that you might have binged on during pregnancy Some



> It’s more common in women who have suffered depression in the past, and may be more likely following a traumatic birth, with mother-baby separation or breastfeeding problems, and in societies in which new mothers have little family and cultural support.



> Purified lanolin is for nipples what lip balm is for lips. It helps keep the cells’ own moisture intact. A healthy nipple doesn’t need ointment, but if your nipple is chapped or slightly damaged, a light coating of purified (to reduce the risk of allergies) lanolin keeps newly formed cells from drying out and allows them to slide easily across the damaged area to bridge the gap more quickly.



> Before you give your baby any supplementation, be sure he really, truly needs it. Giving unnecessary supplements—extra milk besides nursing—is a surefire recipe for decreasing your milk production because your baby will fill up on the supplement and take less of your milk.



> While it’s important to avoid unnecessary supplements, remember that a hungry baby can’t try harder. Babies breastfeed better when they’re calm and not frantically hungry.



> Milk donors are screened for illnesses that can pass into the milk, which is then pasteurized and frozen. Milk from a human milk bank may be available through your hospital or from the milk bank directly with a prescription.



> You’ve probably heard both good and bad things about bottles. They’re the easiest way to supplement large amounts and don’t have much of a learning curve. But a baby who is fed well with a bottle and not a breast can quickly come to prefer the bottle.



> Paced Bottle-Feeding You can help your baby gain control over the feeding and avoid overfeeding by pausing the feeding periodically. If



> Switch sides at least once a feeding to help prevent a side preference when breastfeeding. This also helps stimulate equal eye and facial muscle development.



> If you suspect your baby is tongue-tied, you’ll need to see a doctor to actually diagnose the problem and to treat it. Usually all that’s required is a quick snip or two—called a frenotomy—by a dentist or doctor with a small pair of blunt-end scissors or laser in his office.



> Vasospasms usually occur as a result of nipple trauma—a nipple’s way of saying, “Ow!” It’s also fairly common in women who have had breast or nipple surgery, possibly due to nerve or tissue damage. Some drugs, including nicotine and caffeine, can contribute to vasospasm.



> Healthy babies can gain at very different rates. Scales can differ. Growth charts conflict. Sometimes everyone forgets to look at the baby as well as the numbers. And sometimes there really is a problem, and the scale can alert you and let you know when things turn around.



> Since all scales are calibrated differently, it’s very important to have your baby weighed on the same scale each time, wearing the same or similar clothes. Avoid weighing a fully fed baby one time and a hungry baby the next.



> Once you’ve gotten accurate weight information, take a close look at your baby. Is she plump and rounded in appearance? Of course, if she was premature or born “small for dates,” it may take a few weeks to get that chubby baby look, but slow-gaining babies who are doing well usually have rounded cheeks, plump thighs, and creases around their wrists and ankles. That plump look is a good sign; loose “puppy skin” on legs and arms should disappear with a week or so of good feeding.



> How is she behaving and developing? Does she relax after feedings (hands open, arms limp) and stay content for at least a few minutes? Is she hitting developmental milestones for smiling, reaching for objects, etc.? Is she energetic? These are all good signs.



> Are you seeing enough poopy diapers (in the first six weeks, at least three a day larger than the “okay” finger sign)? Another good sign.



> Research has shown that babies in the lowest percentiles during the first year do just as well in terms of later intellectual and physical development as babies in the higher percentiles.



> Unlike formula-fed babies, exclusively breastfed babies who gain rapidly are not at increased risk of obesity. Most of these babies start to slow their growth by six months or so,



> In 1956, the average American woman no longer participated in her own baby’s birth. Many women feared birth, or didn’t believe themselves capable of unmedicated birth. LLL encouraged women to trust their bodies; its founders were among the first women to promote the presence of husbands in the delivery room and a return to home birth for those who want it.



> LLL spoke out: babies need their mothers, and mothers benefit, too, from early nursing and uninterrupted bonding. Today women are encouraged to hold and nurse their newborn babies immediately after birth.



> COUNT ONLY POOPY diapers that have contents at least as big as the “okay” circle you make with thumb and forefinger. No need to count wet diapers. Poopy diapers tell more about how a baby is doing.



> If he’s not gaining well and he sleeps more than three hours at a stretch, aim for at least ten nursings each day until he wakes on his own and has at least four good poopy diapers each day.



> A baby starts with subtle nursing cues—eyes moving beneath eyelids, eyelids fluttering before they even open, hands coming toward face, mouth movements. Then she adds more obvious ones—rooting toward your chest, whimpering or squeaking. If you offer to nurse now, she’ll probably take your breast gently and easily.



> Colostrum: collect drops on plastic spoon, tip into baby’s mouth or collect with dropper. Milk: Express into pump funnel or large bowl.



> Research has found that breastfeeding works best when the baby is fed in response to hunger cues, not on a schedule. That’s usually quite frequently, especially in the beginning. Fortunately, you can’t feed too often.



> Hold off buying things until you know whether you’re ever going to use them—like a crib or changing table. Don’t get caught up in the consumerism of new parenthood.



> The ideal adult-to-baby ratio is about three to one the first week. But if all you have is one mother and one baby, you’ll manage. When



> After a week or so, get out of the house. The crying doesn’t bother other people as much as you think it does, and even the grocery store can seem like a wonderful adventure.



> Mastitis means an inflammation in your breast. It’s sometimes due to an infection, but may not be. Signs include: A warm or hot, sensitive (sometimes painful) area on one breast (rarely both) that may look red or have reddish streaks Sometimes fever and/or chills and/or generalized aching, as though you have the flu.



> Empty Breast, Lots of Rest. That means (a) frequently nursing, pumping, or hand-expressing to keep the milk moving and (b) spending as much time as possible in bed or lying down, resting or sleeping. Cold packs



> Is your baby thriving … but nursing is a struggle? Do these sound familiar? My baby chokes and gulps and splutters when she nurses. My breasts always feel full, and/or they spray when my milk releases. My baby “wrestles” with my breast, pulling off, crying, tugging, arching. My baby has lots of wet and poopy diapers. My baby is colicky, or gassy, or spits up frequently. My baby sometimes—or always—has frothy or greenish stools. Some diapers may have a little blood. My baby is gaining rapidly, or grew fast at first with weight gain dropping as fussiness increased. My baby rarely falls asleep at my breast; nursing is an athletic event. My baby will nurse only for food, not for comfort. My baby grimaces when she nurses.



> The milk that builds up in our breasts between feedings tends to be a lower-fat milk, changing gradually from “soup” to “cheesecake” through the feeding. If we have too much milk, she may not get through all the soup at one sitting.



> You may find your baby is happier and more settled if you let her “get to the bottom of the barrel,” where the cheesecake is, by doing two things: Offer to nurse whenever she shows interest, even after just a few minutes. Shorter intervals mean the higher fat milk is still there. If she’s happy on one side, leave her there. If that side isn’t nice and soft afterward, use it again next time. Using one side for a couple hours may be all it takes.



> If your baby is still getting lots of wet and poopy diapers, and looks relaxed and comfortable during and after nursing, these are signs of good milk supply.



> Feed the baby when he shows hunger cues, not on a schedule. Hold the baby snugly. Keep him fairly upright to give him control.



> Keep him fairly upright, so that the bottle is nearly horizontal when it’s in his mouth. The milk won’t pour into him automatically, and he’ll have much more control.



> Store in the back of the freezer away from sides, where temperature is most steady. If storing milk in bags, double-bag them or store in sealed container to avoid freezer burn. Horizontal bags may save space. Use the oldest frozen milk first to keep it from getting too old.
