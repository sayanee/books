Why sleep habits from infants is important

> The prevention and treatment of unhealthy sleep habits in infants and young children is important, because if those habits are uncorrected, they will persist. There is no automatic correction. Children do not simply outgrow these problems. Adult sleep specialists commonly see incurable adult insomniacs, chronically disabled from sleepiness and dependent on sleeping pills, who correctly describe themselves as never sleeping well as children.

Second wind

> Overtired children are fatigued, and the body’s natural response to fatigue is to fight it by producing a stimulating chemical. This “second wind” of stimulating energy causes a hyperalert or hypervigilant state that prevents easy entry into sleep or sleeping for long periods.

Sleep deficiency

> Likewise, **sleep deficiency in childhood may harm neurological development**; the problems remain “hidden,” not showing up until later. I think it is quite possible that unhealthy childhood sleep habits contribute to **school-related problems such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and learning disabilities**.

Emotional regulation

> I also suspect chronically tired children become chronically tired adults who suffer in ways we can’t measure, including less resiliency, less ability to cope with life’s stresses, less curiosity, less empathy, and less playfulness. The message is simple: **sleep is a powerful modifier of mood, behavior, performance, and personality**.



> Difficulties in learning how to walk used to occur when walkers were popular, because they interfered with the natural development of a normal gait. Difficulties in learning how to sleep occur when parents do not respect and protect the child’s natural, periodic need to sleep.



> And school itself has grown more demanding, with children expected to master more knowledge and skills at an earlier age than ever before, to say nothing of the demands placed on students by sports programs and other extracurricular activities. All of this runs the risk of interfering with naps and early bedtimes for children, ironically making it more difficult for them to learn. Sleep



> Let’s face it, no parent is perfect, and no baby does exactly what you expect. I will offer guidelines for you to pick and choose from and for you to modify to fit your family. Flexibility is absolutely essential to find what works for you and your child.



> 1. Sleep duration: night and day 2. Naps 3. Sleep consolidation 4. Sleep schedule, timing of sleep 5. Sleep regularity



> 1. At 6 weeks, night sleep lengthens. 2. At 12 to 16 weeks, daytime sleep regularizes, with two major naps and a variable third nap. 3. At 9 months, night waking for feeding disappears, as does the third nap. 4. At 12 to 21 months, the midmorning nap disappears. 5. At 3 to 4 years, the midday nap becomes less common.



> The pace of these changes is especially quick during the first several months, so it is easy for a parent to get a little off tempo. Just when you think you have figured out when your baby needs to nap or be put to bed at night, the circadian timing system sends your baby new instructions!



> The goal is to recognize and respect your child’s need to sleep and not do things that interfere with the natural sleep process.



> During their first few days, newborns sleep about sixteen to seventeen hours total each day, although their longest single sleep period is only four to five hours.



> Nursing mothers often worry unnecessarily that long sleep periods deprive their baby of adequate breast milk. Weight checks with the doctor will reassure you that all is well.



> Young infants are very portable. You can take them anywhere you want, and when they need to sleep, they will.



> After 6 weeks of age, he became more socially aware of people around him; after about 4 months of age, he, like all children, became interested in barking dogs, wind in the trees, clouds, and many other curious things, all of which could and did disturb his sleep, either by waking him up or by making him fight to stay awake.



> A much more likely candidate for influencing a baby’s sleeping patterns is the hormone melatonin, which is produced by the baby’s brain beginning at about 3 to 4 months of age. This hormone surges at night and has the capability to both induce drowsiness and relax the smooth muscles encircling the gut. So around 3 or 4 months of age, so-called day/night confusion and apparent abdominal cramps (colic) begin to disappear.



> What we can conclude, therefore, is that for infants under 3 or 4 months of age you should try to flow with the child’s need for sleep. Don’t expect predictable sleep schedules, and don’t try to enforce them rigidly.



> During the second half of the twentieth century, a trend toward earlier start times for high school developed. This forced children to get up earlier during the school week and reduced the total number of hours available for sleeping. At the same time, it became more popular for teenagers to hold part-time jobs after school, and participation in extracurricular sports became more prevalent and demanding, so teenagers were going to bed later. Further, the amount of homework has increased.



> In 9- to 16-year-olds, the timing of sleep, not just sleep duration, makes a big difference. Even when the sleep duration is the same, those children who went to bed later did less vigorous exercise each day and had more periods of physical inactivity than children with an earlier bedtime.



> Having a TV in the bedroom is associated with sleep problems and less sleeping. More recently, cell phone and computer use at night has pushed bedtimes even later.



> One easy thing you can do is keep all screen-based media devices out of the bedroom at bedtime.



> At 5 months of age, the infants who were cooing, smiling, adaptable, and regular (their sleep times and hungry times were around the same time every day) and who curiously approached unfamiliar things or people slept longer than infants with opposite characteristics.



> Infants who were fussy, crying, irritable, hard to handle, irregular, and more withdrawn slept almost three hours less overall, almost a 20 percent difference (three hours during the day and nine and a half hours at night, or twelve and a half hours total).



> infants who sleep more during the day are better able to learn from their environment; this is because they have a better-developed ability to maintain focused or sustained attention.



> By 3 years of age, the easier-to-manage children in my study—mild, positive in mood, adaptable, and more likely to approach unfamiliar people—slept twelve and a half hours total.



> An important conclusion is that 3-year-olds who nap are more adaptable than those who do not. But napping did not affect the length of sleep at night. Comparing nappers and non-nappers, night sleep duration was ten and a half hours in both groups.



> Therefore, it simply is not true that children who miss naps will “make up” for it by sleeping more at night. In fact, the sleep they miss is gone forever.



> These higher cognitive abilities appear to be essential for academic performance and success. In contrast, there were no deficits on rote performance or less complex memory and learning tasks.



> My interpretation of this study is that chronic sleepiness in infants and young children impairs cognitive development, but this does not become apparent until the child is much older and challenged by more complex tasks.



> When children are younger, the challenges they face are at a much lower level, and these chronically sleep-deprived children may still do well with spelling, writing, reading, and simple arithmetic. Later, when they are older, more demanding academic challenges unmask the cognitive deficits lurking there all along.



> This increase has been noted in some other studies and suggests that teenagers need more sleep than preteens. Yet, as noted previously, academic demands, social events, and school sports combine during adolescence to pressure teenagers to stay up later and later.



> Level Description 1. Feeling active and vital; alert; wide awake 2. Functioning at a high level, but not at peak; still able to concentrate 3. Relaxed; awake; not at full alertness; responsive 4. A little foggy; not at peak; let down



> Fogginess; beginning to lose interest in remaining awake; slowed down 6. Sleepiness; preferring to be lying down; fighting sleep; woozy 7. Almost in reverie; sleep onset soon; lost struggle to remain awake



> While it is true that infants who are usually well rested yawn on occasions when they are overtired, it seems that chronically sleepy infants do not yawn much or nod off. Instead, when most young kids get too sleepy, they get grumpy and excitable.



> In this study, adult volunteers reported their moods on four scales: 1. Tired to rested 2. Sluggish to alert 3. Irritable to calm 4. Tense to relaxed



> fatigue produces an increase in adrenaline concentrations. That is, when we are tired, our body chemically responds with a burst of adrenaline to give us more drive or energy. We become more aroused, alert, and excitable. Concentrations of cortisol also increase with increasing alertness. In children, cortisol concentrations remain high when they do not nap.



> Here are some terms used by professionals to describe the behavior of hyperalert children with disturbed sleep: Physiological activation Neurological arousal Excessive wakefulness Emotional reactivity Heightened sensitivity



> In dramatic contrast, over and over again I have seen well-rested children in my practice who spend enormous amounts of time in a state of quiet alertness. They take in everything with wide-open eyes, never missing a thing. They find simple little toys amusing or curious. They never appear bored, even though the toy they pick up may be one they have played with many times. The



> A calm and alert state is a sign of sleeping well. Upon awakening, well-rested children are in good cheer and are able to play by themselves.



> the harmful effects of excessive daytime sleepiness do not stay the same, but rather tend to accumulate. This means that there is a progressive worsening in a child’s mood and performance even when the amount of lost sleep each day or night is constant.



> The childhood-onset insomniacs take longer to fall asleep and sleep less than adult-onset insomniacs. I think these data support the hypothesis that the failure to establish good sleeping habits in infancy or early childhood has long-term harmful effects, such as adult insomnia.



> But many children suffering from insufficient sleep appear fine during most of the day, only to exhibit the symptoms listed below as the sleep tank begins to go dry near the end of the day (4:00–5:00 p.m. for children under the age of 3 years, and 5:00–7:00 p.m. for children 3 years and older). This is known as the “witching hour.” A child experiencing the witching hour may be irritable, easily upset, clinging, whining, fussy, peevish, or, in the words of one mother, “clawing at my breast.”



> This state of hyperarousal is most obvious in a young child in the late afternoon or early evening when his sleep tank is almost empty and he is running on fumes because of missed naps, bedtimes that are too late, or both.



> Not napping well causes his sleep tank to go toward empty by the end of the day and results in an even higher state of arousal, so it now becomes even more difficult for him to easily fall asleep and stay asleep at night.



> Of course, the child eventually crashes. But before he does so, he is in an unhealthy state that gives rise to stressful parent-child interactions, stressful interactions between parents, and stress for each parent as an individual.



> It’s a virtuous circle: sleep begets sleep. It’s also a vicious circle: sleeplessness begets sleeplessness.



> A study published in 2015 showed that naps enhance the consolidation of memory among infants at 6 and 12 months. Further, infants who have longer naps are better able to remember novel actions than infants who take naps for 30 minutes or less.



> Although sleep inertia might result from cumulative sleepiness from a too-late bedtime, my observation is that it can also result from a too-long interval of wakefulness before the nap.



> So it is entirely possible that during the first 4 months of a newborn’s life, when sleep states are developing, partial states express themselves out of phase and in conjunction with other states, creating overlap problems that we refer to as fussiness, colic, or sleep inertia.



> I believe that healthy naps lead to optimal daytime alertness for learning—that is, naps adjust the alert/drowsy control to just the right setting for optimal daytime arousal. Without naps, the child is too drowsy to learn well.



> …A lack of sleep in contexts that rely on young children’s mastery of new information (e.g., preschool) may have significant and potentially dire long-term consequences.”



> Another study, by Dr. Janice Bell, showed that “insufficient nighttime sleep among infants and preschool-aged children may be a lasting risk factor for subsequent obesity. Napping does not appear to be a substitute for nighttime sleep” (emphasis added).



> Not only are naps different from night sleep, but not every nap is created equal. There is more REM sleep in the midmorning nap compared to the midday nap. During a nap, the duration of REM sleep within a nap, not simply the total duration of the nap, is related to creative problem solving.



> Research also suggests that high amounts of REM sleep, under the influence of low melatonin levels, help direct the course of brain maturation in early life.



> Because naps have their own function and do their job best when they occur at the right time, I suggest that if a nap has been missed, try to keep your child up until the next sleep period in order to maintain the timeliness of the sleep rhythm.



> My studies show that at 4 months of age, most children take either two or three naps. The third nap, if taken, tends to be brief and in the late afternoon or early evening.



> But by 6 months of age, the vast majority of children (84 percent) are taking only two naps; by 9 months of age, virtually all children are taking just one or two naps.



> The single nap that is present by 21 months and resurfaces in adolescence or adulthood is always the midday or later-afternoon nap. Infants and young children have much more REM sleep at night than older children, and the midmorning nap has more REM sleep than the midday nap;



> Not all sleep periods are created equal! Long naps do not compensate for late bedtimes. Sleep quality, not just sleep duration, is an essential component of healthy sleep.



> Late bedtimes rob your child of deep, restorative sleep occurring before midnight, and this lost high-quality sleep is not made up for by lighter early morning sleep or additional daytime sleep. Long naps are not a substitute for less night sleep.



> Sleep is not the absence of wakefulness; rather, the brain automatically and actively turns on the sleep process and simultaneously turns off wakefulness. You and your child can force wakefulness upon sleep, but you cannot force sleep upon wakefulness.



> My interpretation is that by 21 months, biology is no longer the primary influence on napping; social factors begin to play a role.



> As mentioned before, there is more active REM sleep than quiet sleep in the first nap, and this pattern is reversed in the second nap. So naps occurring at different times are different! Even for adults, a nap earlier in the day is lighter and less restorative than an midday nap, which consists of deeper sleep.



> Do not expect your baby to nap well outside his crib after 4 months of age. If you don’t protect your baby’s nap schedules, you can produce nap deprivation.



> By 3 years of age, children who do not nap or who nap very little are often described as nonadaptable or even hyperactive. Adaptability is thought to be a very important trait for school success.



> Earlier bedtimes help prevent bedtime battles, deter night waking, discourage extremely early morning awakenings, and regularize and prolong naps.



> These parents mistakenly think that a later bedtime will make the child more tired and resist sleep less.



> We started off with a 7:00 p.m. bedtime. She still woke up in the late evening to eat, but we put her promptly back to bed. There were a few bumps in the road for the first couple of nights—sometimes she would wake up a few times and cry—but we kept at it. After a few days, Jaden went from sleeping a four-to-five-hour stretch in the evening, to seven, then eight, then nine or ten hours a night.



> Her daytime naps even seemed longer and more restful. She is now 7 months old. We now try to get her down between 6:00 and 6:30 each night, and she is extremely happy about it. (So are we!)



> It has been almost four weeks since our 9-month appointment. Bedtime is an absolute joy. Meg eats dinner, takes a bath, and is in bed about 6:30 p.m.



> Much to our shock and delight, the first night we tried the new routine, Jared was asleep after five minutes of crying, and remained asleep for eleven hours, not waking until 5:30 the next morning.



> Jared wakes up happy, energized, and ready for a day full of adventures. Now, several months later, Jared is most happy when going to bed at 6:30 p.m., and will go to his bed himself if he is tired.



> Family, friends, even strangers constantly tell us what a happy, cheerful child we have. The reality is that she is a very well-rested child.



> Of course, once in a while—when relatives visit or when a painful ear infection keeps the child awake—a child will make up for lost daytime sleep with longer night sleep. But day in and day out, you should not expect to satisfy your child’s need to sleep by cutting corners on naps and then trying to compensate by putting your child to sleep for the night at an earlier hour.



> How well do you nap in a car or on a plane compared to in your bed? I think babies have better-quality, more restorative sleep when they are sleeping in a stationary crib, bed, or bassinet. Vibration or motion during sleep appears to force the brain to a lighter sleep state and reduce the restorative power of the nap.



> In general, however, as the brain matures, the child’s increasing curiosity and social awareness make it more difficult to have good naps outside, so be careful.



> Consolidated sleep means uninterrupted sleep, sleep that is continuous and not disrupted by awakenings. Slumber broken by awakenings or complete arousals is known as disrupted sleep or sleep fragmentation. Abnormal shifts of sleep rhythms toward lighter sleep, even if we do not awaken completely, may also cause sleep fragmentation.



> The effects of sleep fragmentation are similar to the effects of reduced total sleep: daytime sleepiness increases and performance measurably decreases.



> Arousals may also prevent crib death, or sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), which kills young infants. This tragedy might be caused by a failure to maintain breathing during sleep or a failure to awaken when breathing starts to become difficult.



> After 4 months, naps of much less than one hour cannot count as “real” naps. Sometimes a nap of forty-five minutes may be all your child needs, but naps of less than thirty minutes don’t help.



> After 6 weeks of age, the peak of wakefulness and fussiness passes, and babies sleep longer at night. So do moms! Also, babies start social smiling at their parents, and they become less fussy or irritable.



> Mothers, especially nursing mothers, should learn to nap when their baby naps. You never know what the night will bring; you might be up a lot holding, walking, or nursing.



> It is important to have a fairly regular routine of soothing events before putting your child to sleep, but it makes biological sense to vary the bedtime a little.



> If your child is unusually active in the afternoon or if she misses a good midday nap, then she should be put to sleep earlier.



> If the parent returns very late, the child should be put to bed as usual; keeping a tired child up to play with a tired parent does no one any good.



> Morning time includes bathing, dressing, feeding, and playing, and may substitute for evening time. Because of the family’s early bedtime, the weekends are enjoyably relaxed since everyone is well rested.



> For young children in day care, dual-career families with long commutes, and older children with scheduled activities, it may be impossible to catch that magical drowsy state. These children will be better off if the bedtime occurs at approximately the same time every night.



> Dr. Bates hypothesized that those children with chronically variable sleep schedules might experience states similar to jet lag syndrome, characterized as nagging fatigue and cognitive disorientation.



> The researchers discovered that a more irregular sleep schedule was associated with more daytime sleepiness. These teenagers had lower grades, more injuries associated with alcohol or drugs, and more days missed from school.



> So it makes sense to vary the bedtime by thirty to sixty minutes—but no more than that—based on how your child looks and behaves during the late afternoon.



> After 6 weeks of age, as temperatures fall more with sleep, the sleep periods get longer. By 12 to 16 weeks, all babies show consistent temperature rhythms.



> The magic moment is a slight quieting, a lull in being busy, a slight staring off, and a hint of calmness. If you catch this wave of tiredness and put the child to sleep then, there will be no crying.



> Not only do the adults describe themselves as more sleepy and mentally exhausted, but they also feel more stressed. The stress may be a direct consequence of partial sleep deprivation or it may result from the challenge of coping with increasing amounts of daytime sleepiness.



> Part of the problem is, of course, that we don’t have yardsticks to measure items such as creativity or empathy, so we do not yet have a way to measure the contribution that healthy sleep during childhood might make.



> Because the change in routine was small and in the past, they don’t even think about it. But during our conversation they will recall that because of the longer spring and summer days, or because “it didn’t seem to cause any problems,” they pushed the child’s bedtime back.



> Contrary to many parents’ fears, sleeping on the back does not cause a misshapen skull. In the past, tradition and social circumstances dictated which sleeping position most parents selected. Now it appears that sleeping on the back is healthier because it helps prevent sudden infant death syndrome.



> Actually, leaving the child alone allows the child to learn to sleep in different positions. If you roll your child back and he instantaneously returns to sleep, obviously there is no problem.



> Place your baby to sleep on his back for every sleep up to 1 year of age. If he rolls onto his stomach by himself, he may be left in that position. Place your baby to sleep on a firm sleep surface. Keep soft objects, loose bedding, or any objects that could increase the risk of entrapment, suffocation, or strangulation out of the crib. Place your baby to sleep in the same room where you sleep but not the same bed. Breast-feed as much and for as long as you can. Schedule and go to all well-child visits. Keep your baby away from smokers and places where people smoke. Do not let your baby get too hot.



> The single most important fact to remember is that the time when sleep occurs may be more important than the duration of the sleep period. You can’t fight circadian rhythms!



> Sleep that occurs in sync with circadian rhythms is more restorative and of better quality than sleep that occurs out of sync with circadian rhythms. Jet lag syndrome is an example of sleep not in sync with circadian rhythms.



> “that those who are chronically sleep deprived may no longer be capable of reliably appraising their own sleepiness.…[This] may explain why sleep restriction is widely practiced: People have the subjective impression they have adapted to it because they don’t feel particularly sleepy.”



> But here’s the good news: we know now that the brain primarily makes up for sleep loss by increasing sleep intensity (slow-wave EEG activity during non-REM sleep), and not necessarily by increasing sleep duration.



> More children have a television in their bedrooms and use their computers or cell phones at night, causing the bedtime to be later. More mothers with young children are in the labor force, and the use of center-based day care has increased, rendering quality naps and early bedtimes more difficult to obtain.



> Family conflict and marital strife. Family conflict at ages 7–15 years predicts insomnia at age 18,



> Emotional unavailability of the mother at bedtime (measured by using multiple video cameras) predicts infant sleep quality for children 1–24 months of age.



> Feeding or attending to the child whenever the child vocalizes,



> Parental presence in bedroom until child falls asleep. Maternal smoking during pregnancy. Television in the child’s bedroom. Caffeine consumption in older children. Eczema and snoring should be discussed with your child’s health care provider. Bed sharing during the first 6 months is associated with chronic awakenings.



> The elements of healthy sleep are: 1. Sleep duration: night and day.



> 2. Naps. Is your child taking naps, or do you sometimes or often skip naps?



> 3. Sleep consolidation. Is the sleep interrupted (fragmented) or uninterrupted (consolidated)?



> 4. Sleep schedule, timing of sleep. Do naps start and bedtimes begin just when your child is becoming drowsy? A bedtime that is too late will produce an abnormal daytime sleep schedule.



> 5. Sleep regularity. Do naps or bedtimes occur at approximately the same times?



> 6. Prevent sudden infant death syndrome (see this page). Recommendations by the American Academy of Pediatrics include room sharing but not bed sharing, and having the baby sleep on its back, not its stomach or side.



> Our goal is to have well-rested families. But always remember, the amount of sleep our children need is measured by mood, behavior, and performance, not by hours on a clock. The best advice I can give parents is this: let your child’s natural sleep rhythms do their job without unnecessary interference!



> Of course, children will spontaneously fall asleep when totally exhausted—“crashing” is a biological necessity! But this is unhealthy, because extreme fatigue (often identified by “wired” behavior immediately preceding the crash) interferes with normal social interactions and even learning.



> Once, mistakenly, it was widely believed that the early introduction of solid foods helped babies sleep better and, separately, that fatter babies were healthier babies. At that time, the dangers of food allergies and obesity were not recognized.



> Challenges to Nurture Babies Urban stimulation



> Social isolation (forcing only the mother to be wholly responsible for the baby’s soothing and sleeping) may cause intense stress for the mother.



> Busy modern lifestyles mean that parents have many things to do and little time to do them; sometimes they have to take their baby with them even at sleep times.



> Fathers or mothers who have a long commute and return home from work late want to play with their baby, and so they keep their baby up too late at night. Digital and social media distraction interferes with healthy sleep routines.



> The sleeping brain is not a resting brain. 2. The sleeping brain functions in a different manner than the waking brain. 3. The activity and work of the sleeping brain are purposeful. 4. The process of falling asleep is learned. 5. Providing the growing brain with sufficient sleep is necessary for developing the ability to concentrate and fostering an easier temperament.



> The notion of optimal wakefulness, also called optimal alertness, is important, because we tend to think about the states of sleep and waking



> Sleep is the power source that keeps your mind alert and calm. Every night and at every nap, sleep recharges the brain’s battery. Sleeping well increases brainpower just as lifting weights builds stronger muscles, because sleeping well increases your attention span and allows you to be physically relaxed and mentally alert at the same time.



> Sweet, bright, and caring children who are receiving unhealthy sleep will become even sweeter, brighter, and more caring when they get healthier sleep. My research shows that sleep modulates temperament, so sleeping better makes children more adaptable, cooperative, and calmer.



> We should not be surprised that sleep deficiency is dangerous, because we know that iron deficiency in babies can cause permanent harm. Specifically, iron-deficient babies become adolescents with poorer cognitive functioning and then become adults with poorer emotional health, more negative emotions, and feelings of isolation.



> Sleep, like iron, is a biological necessity. Both are important for brain development.



> Short-term sleep deprivation for airplane pilots, doctors in training, and truck drivers is so dangerous that sleep requirements for these occupations are highly regulated.



> Children age 2 to 3 years who had problems getting to sleep and staying asleep had higher levels of both internalizing and externalizing behaviors (externalizing behaviors are directed against others or things and might manifest in such ways as overactivity, anger, aggression, impulsivity, tantrums, and annoying behavior).



> There are strong indications that sleep and brain maturation are closely related.…I believe inadequate sleep in childhood may affect the maturation of the brain related to the emergence of development or mood disorders.”



> Less sleep is associated with aggression, defiance, noncompliance, oppositional behavior, acting out, and hyperactivity.



> [C]umulative small additions to sleep duration potentially improve functioning in school” (emphasis added). I know it goes against the grain of human nature to believe that such small changes could have such a profound impact, but the data bear it out



> Although late bedtimes (at or after 11:45 p.m.) were linked to shorter amount of total sleep time, total sleep time was not linked to emotional distress. So sleep before midnight is associated with better emotional health independent of total sleep time! In



> Experimental sleep deprivation studies in adults show that sleep deprivation temporarily changes brain function. These changes can manifest as impairments in interpersonal functioning, such as reduced empathy toward others.



> Short sleep duration in adolescents is associated with higher blood pressure, higher cholesterol, and higher insulin resistance (a risk factor for developing diabetes). Increased susceptibility to infection, increased stress hormone, and systemic inflammation also result from not sleeping well.



> Naps reduce cortisol levels in infants. Naps in preschool children boost memory. In adults, naps enhance creative problem solving.



> there was a strong association between the amount of time infants were in REM sleep and the amount of time they spent when awake in the behavioral state called “quiet alertness.” In the quiet alert state, babies have open, bright eyes, they appear alert, their eyes are scanning, their faces are relaxed, and they do not smile or frown. Their bodies are relatively quiet and inactive.



> Infants who are notoriously not quiet alert are those with colic or a difficult temperament. Their fussy behavior may be due to imbalances of internal chemicals such as progesterone or even cortisol. High cortisol concentrations in infants have been shown to be associated with decreased duration of non-REM sleep.



> I’ve found that how long the infant sleeps during the day is strongly associated with persistence or attention span. Infants who take long naps have longer attention spans. They spend more time in the quiet alert state and seem to learn faster.



> The truth is that these infant-stimulation groups are often not important for infants but instead serve legitimate parental needs by allowing mothers and fathers to meet other parents and escape from their isolation at home.



> The research papers agree that healthy sleep enhances cognitive development because sleep incorporates learning into permanent memory or causes memory consolidation, and that sleep enhances organizational skills, planning, multitasking, and executive functioning.



> The parents’ responses overwhelmingly supported the following simple conclusions: 1. Because your older child appreciates how she feels better with healthy sleep, she strives for sleep.



> 2. Healthy sleep continues in the older child because the parents have established a foundation for it:



> Times and events changed as they aged, but the main idea was still the same: consistency in our healthy choices—food, exercise, and sleep. We did not specifically have to tell our high school or college age children to go to bed; it was a routine that grew with our family.



> What we learned very early on was to stick to a schedule a majority of the time, and when the exceptions happen, the healthy habits are still intact.



> model healthy sleep routines myself. Go to bed early, read rather than watch TV before bed, and keep the bedroom for sleeping and quieter activities.



> In fact, we believe it helped us learn how to prioritize how, when, and where we spent our time. As a result, we see our children making similar choices on their own.



> The number one reason, we believe, the bedtime process is relatively easy is 100 percent a result of the commitment and understanding from the early months and years. They love to sleep. They find their beds a safe and restful place.



> your child needs a great deal of sleep, your child will be happy and healthy when they are rested, and your family will benefit from rested children.



> He is now 13, and even with his homework load, a five-nights/week swim schedule, and weekly youth group participation, Trystan “owns” the decision to head up to bed by 9:00 p.m. each evening.



> In the beginning, it may not be easy to follow guidelines for healthy sleep because family and friends will resist your emphasis on healthy sleep schedules. They do this because your child’s need-to-sleep schedule may conflict with their social schedule. They will accuse you of being too rigid,



> Remember, the key message is that there will be less resistance from your older child because he or she will have developed more self-awareness or body awareness regarding how it feels to be well rested versus short on sleep.



> I want to emphasize that when family routines and consistency in living according to your family values are practiced from the beginning, the preteen and teenage years are more manageable.



> We had to reinforce the benefits of sleep, things like not having shadows under their eyes, keeping the diary of how much better they felt when well rested, and performing better in sports.



> Sleep problems in children may cause depression in mothers. However, maternal depression may also cause sleep problems in children



> Nighttime entertainment, sports, and socializing are so common today that we don’t even think about it. But it wasn’t always so. I suspect that most adults used to have an earlier bedtime, and I suspect that very young children who were too young to do chores or work by candlelight also went to bed earlier than today.



> Hopefully in the future it will become common knowledge that television does not belong in your child’s bedroom. In fact, all screen-based electronic media used by children at night may cause the bedtime to become later.



> Occasionally they feel a little like outcasts because they refuse to frequently socialize late at night with other parents or relatives with their child. Sometimes not attending late night events or leaving early may have social costs. Similarly, parents may choose not to participate in playdates as frequently or go to family barbeques on weekends if they interfere with naps.



> When in doubt about whether to attend a social event with your child that will cause a late bedtime or a missed nap, I always encourage a family to attend the event. After the event, I recommend they consider a super-early bedtime for one night only, to repay a sleep debt.



> Self-soothing is the ability of your child to fall deeply asleep with or without a pacifier or swaddling after becoming drowsy from a parent’s soothing efforts. The drowsy child is placed in a crib before she is in a deep sleep and allowed to fall asleep on her own, without parental intervention.



> However, the motion of rocking or pushing your baby for hours in a stroller for “soothing” might rob your baby of more restorative deep sleep even though he is in light slumber.



> My impression is that self-soothing skills are a prerequisite for long-term healthy sleep habits, and the earlier they are developed, the easier it is for the entire family.



> If your baby always falls asleep in his mother’s arms after feeding, then he is less able to develop self-soothing skills because he learns to fall asleep only in association with his mother’s body odor, skin contact, heartbeat and breathing rhythm, and rocking motions. After breast-feeding, the mother should sometimes pass her child to someone else for soothing to sleep.



> Mothers were initially sometimes doubtful either of their husband’s coping or of their own ability to tolerate these new arrangements.” Research suggests that mothers play the role of “gatekeeping,” either encouraging or inhibiting the father’s involvement.



> But remember, falling asleep under different conditions promotes the learning of self-soothing skills. Dads might be available only on weekends and only for naps. No matter. Some attempts are better than none. So get dads, or others, on board!



> the mother is giving expressed breast milk in a bottle, fathers and babies may have an easier time accomplishing the feeding if the mother actually leaves the house. This is because the baby can smell the mother’s presence and might resist taking the bottle if he knows his mother is home.



> This is a little bit tricky because many mothers have the attitude that nobody can do the soothing as well as they can, and also that dads need their rest so they can go out to work well rested in the morning.



> If your child often shows signs of fatigue, note how long he has been awake and the next time begin the soothing-to-sleep routine about twenty minutes earlier. It is not necessary for your child to always be drowsy and awake when you put him down.



> There is nothing wrong if your newborn sometimes or usually falls asleep at your breast, in your arms, on Dad’s chest, or in the swing, car, or stroller. If he falls asleep during feeding, do not awaken him.



> But here is the problem: if he is always in a deep sleep state when you put him down, then he has no opportunity to learn self-soothing skills. So I suggest that you sometimes put him down after soothing, drowsy but awake.



> The baby should be awake when you put her down for her nap. You aren’t trying to ease her down and then sneak out—you want her to be able to fall asleep on her own, without rocking, patting, and so on.



> Junk sleep has no label to read, so instead you must learn to “read” your child. Even when there is not a full-blown “witching hour,” a child might often have mild fussiness or irritability in the late afternoon.



> A study of children at 3, 6, and 11 months of age showed that increased night sleep is associated with an increased likelihood of approaching new and strange people and things. But fragmented sleep between 6 and 36 months of age is associated with a more difficult temperament.



> When you put him down drowsy but awake and he cries hard, immediately pick him up for more soothing and try again some other time that day or the next day. If he makes very quiet sounds, wait and see. He might drift off to sleep or begin to cry hard. If he now begins to cry hard, quickly pick him up.



> What exactly is soothing to a drowsy state? Soothing is restoring a peaceful state. To soothe your newborn is to render her calm or quiet, to bring her to a composed condition by reducing the force or intensity of fussiness or crying.



> Bodily contact, sucking, and gentle rhythmic motions over long periods of time seem to work best for soothing. Sometimes loud mechanical sounds like the garbage disposal or hair dryer seem to help.



> Rhythmic motions are one of the most effective methods of soothing your infant. Use a cradle, rocking chair, baby swing, or Snugli; take the baby for automobile rides, dance with her, or simply walk with her.



> Rhythmic rocking motions might occur in an old-fashioned cradle, a swing, a stroller, your car, or when your baby is carried in your arms or an infant carrier. These activities are fine for soothing, but not for sleeping.



> Sure, your baby can fall asleep in the moving cradle or swing. But it will probably be a light sleep, and your child will miss the full restorative benefit of deeper sleep. Remember, think of sleep quality, not just sleep quantity. In



> As a generalization, I think that planning for naps at home helps parents organize schedules and think about consolidated sleep, naps in sync with biologic rhythms, and reasonably early bedtimes. In contrast, I think that frequent napping in shopping malls and other busy places is associated with children who tend to be chronically mildly short on sleep, so they crash despite all the stimulation around them.



> Wait a minute: of course premature babies are born early! No, not just premature babies—all babies. The theory is that human babies are born earlier compared to other primate babies because as human pelvic bones evolved to support an upright posture, they became narrower. Thus human babies had to be smaller at the time of birth in order to pass through the pelvic opening.



> One particular advantage to massaging your newborn is that the mother or father also directly benefits from this activity. While lovingly stroking your baby, you smile at your baby, talk softly, or sing or hum.



> Since fathers cannot breast-feed their babies, I encourage them to develop an intimate bond with their newborn by practicing baby massage right away—even before any fussiness begins.



> SOOTHING There are many ways to soothe babies but only a few major themes. 1. Rhythmic rocking:



> 2. Sucking: breast, bottle, pacifier, wrist, fingers 3. Gentle pressure: swaddling, massage, soft cloth carriers 4. Sounds: lullabies



> The group also agreed that dads sometimes seemed more effective in soothing because they had a more matter-of-fact approach and talked to the babies as if they were adults.



> think that more mothers and fathers might experiment with a few minutes of quiet crying to allow self-soothing at night in the newborn period if they feel comfortable.



> RESOURCES FOR PARENTS’ ABILITY TO SOOTHE • Father involvement versus absent father • Agreements or disagreements between parents regarding child rearing, such as breast- versus bottle-feeding or crib versus family bed • Absence or presence of marital discord • Absence or presence of intimacy between wife and husband • Absence or presence of baby blues or postpartum depression • Absence or presence of other children requiring attention • Ease or difficulty in breast-feeding • Absence or presence of medical problems in child, mother, father, or other children • Number of bedrooms in the home • Absence or presence of relatives, friends, or neighbors to help out • Help or interference with sleep routines from grandparents • Ability or inability to afford housekeeping help • Ability or inability to afford child care help • Absence or presence of financial pressures such as mother having to return to work soon



> I tell families that the brain wakes up after three or four days, just in time to catch the breast milk that is now available in ample amounts. The baby looks around more with wider eyes and is able to suck with more strength and for longer periods. Within days, the weight loss stops and a dramatic growth in weight, height, and head circumference begins.



> Watch for the signs of drowsiness—quieting of activity, less movement of the arms and legs, eyes that are not as sparkling, eyelids that droop a little, less intense staring at you, and sucking that may be weaker or slower



> If your baby is over 6 weeks old, you may notice less socially responsive smiling, or your baby may be less engaging. This is the time to begin soothing to sleep. All babies become this way within one to two hours of waking.



> But you will have a more peaceful and better-sleeping baby if you respect his need to sleep again within one to two hours after waking. I consider this to be the beginning of teaching self-soothing for babies.



> Before sleep times, reduce stimulation: less noise, dimmer lights, less handling, less playing, lower levels of activity Bedroom should be quiet, dark (use room-darkening shades), and warm, but not too warm



> Bathe Massage after bath with smooth, gentle motions Dress for sleep Swaddle if it comforts and relaxes your baby; use a blanket warm from the clothes dryer Lullaby, quiet singing, listening to music, or humming words, sounds, or phrases Rock Cuddle



> In addition to being consistent in your bedtime routines, try to cultivate patience, because it may take time for your child to get the message that this is not playtime.



> Ask yourself these questions: 1. Do you spend a total of more than three hours per day soothing your baby to prevent crying?



> 2. Do you behave this way more than three days per week?



> 3. Have you been doing this for more than three weeks? If you answered yes to all three questions, then your baby has colic.



> If you answered no to some of the questions but your baby fusses often, especially in the evening and especially around 6 weeks of age, then your baby has common fussiness.



> At night, breast-fed babies are often fed more frequently than formula-fed babies, but it is not known whether this is caused by the breast-feeding mother responding more promptly to her baby’s quiet sounds or whether breast milk is digested faster, causing the baby to wake up more often.



> There are three ways to tell if your baby is truly hungry at night: 1. Pay attention to the suck-swallow pattern. A hungry baby sucks, fills up her mouth, and swallows, so the pattern is suck-swallow, suck-swallow, suck-swallow, and so forth.



> 2. Offer a bottle immediately after breast-feeding in the middle of the night. The well-fed breast-fed baby will not take much from the bottle.



> 3. Once, have Dad offer a bottle instead of Mom breast-feeding in the middle of the night. If your baby is truly hungry or thirsty, she will take a large volume quickly.



> In other words, some parents find that the family bed is a short-term and partial solution to sleep problems, and the sleep problem continues long after the child has been moved to his own crib or bed because the child was not given the opportunity to learn self-soothing skills.



> In contrast, the nursing mother, perhaps more sensitive to the health benefits of nursing, might respond to night waking more often or more rapidly because she perceives herself as primarily responding to her infant’s need for nourishment.



> Around 6 weeks after the due date, a baby’s brain develops the capacity for specific social smiling, more calmness in the evening, longer blocks of sleep at night (four to six hours), and an earlier bedtime.



> Watching her is more important than watching a clock. Synchronize your soothing to sleep with her emerging drowsy cues. Catch the wave. Digital distraction might cause you to miss her emerging subtle drowsy cues.



> But I encourage families to try to avoid a bedtime that is chronically too late and instead focus on morning activities with their baby: bathing, changing, feeding, and playing. Parents are also encouraged to go to bed earlier themselves so they feel less rushed in the morning.



> But they will have the opportunity to thoroughly enjoy their calm baby every morning. And because the family is well rested during the week, weekends are relaxed and fun.



> Therefore, I would tell both parents that one possible benefit of an earlier bedtime was that their child might grow taller due to increased exposure to growth hormone, which is secreted only during sleep and especially before midnight.



> Colicky babies who fail to make this transition from parent-soothed to learning self-soothing at 3 to 4 months are at risk of accumulating a sleep debt and becoming chronically sleep deprived.



> Then attempt to put him to sleep drowsy but awake even though he may be much more drowsy than awake! If he cries hard, pick him up immediately; otherwise you might decide to leave him alone for a short period of time to see if he nods off.



> In contrast, an early bedtime permits long naps to occur because the child awakens in a lower state of neurological arousal. It is easier for parents to catch the wave of drowsy signs, and there is no witching hour. It becomes a virtuous cycle: sleep begets sleep.



> Obviously, watching your child closely for drowsy signs in the late afternoon and early evening is more valuable than watching the clock.



> Nap rhythms begin to emerge around 3–4 months of age. Now parents have the opportunity to “catch the wave” of developing drowsiness and synchronize their soothing to a drowsy-but-awake state with the wave before it crashes into a second wind.



> Typically, the approximate times are around 9:00 a.m. and between 12:00 and 2:00 p.m. An additional nap or naps occur in the late afternoon or early evening.



> Nevertheless, the instructions are to give the child less attention at night, perhaps feeding only twice at night, and ignoring crying for either brief or long periods of time, and to do this for only four or five nights. Sometimes the crying quickly diminishes, especially in the child who had common fussiness.



> The second recurring theme is a control issue. A parent arrogantly asserts that he or she is right no matter what and knows best, end of story. There is no compromise in child raising. No shared philosophy. Just “my way or the highway.”



> Some parents do not feel comfortable enforcing rules and communicating authority. This could be for a variety of reasons. They are not comfortable with telling anyone what to do; they would rather ask for help. They might have a “live and let live” philosophy and do not want to enforce rules.



> “Once the baby is 3 weeks old, healthy, and putting on weight normally, they can begin to delay feedings when baby wakes at night, in order to dissociate waking from feeding.



> Dr. Robert Daniels, a child psychologist, often starts with questions such as: “What is the desired behavior you want from your child? What is the desired outcome? What is the endpoint of treatment? What would you like to see happen?” Both parents need to agree on what the goal is and how to achieve the goal before beginning a treatment plan.



> To maintain healthy sleep for your young child, you need the courage to be firm without feeling guilt or fear that she will resent you or love you less. In fact, the best prescription I can offer for a loving home is a well-rested child and well-rested parents.



> Summary and Action Plan for Exhausted Parents 1. Teach self-soothing.



> Start early. It is never too late to start, but the earlier you start the easier it might be.



> Many hands. Get Dad and others on board. Put your child down drowsy but awake.



> 2. Soothing. Find out what works for your baby.



> 3. Many naps. After a brief interval of wakefulness, put your child down for a nap based on drowsy signs



> 4. Bedtime routines. Consistency helps



> 6. Earlier bedtime around 6 weeks old.



> 7. Protect naps around 3–4 months of age.



> 8. No screens in the bedroom.



> 9. Prevention versus treatment of sleep problems.



> 10. Parent issues or barriers that may make prevention or treatment of sleep problems more challenging.



> IS MY CHILD GETTING HEALTHY SLEEP? After 3–4 months of age, you can tell that your child is not getting healthy sleep if these are present: 1. Witching hour behavior



> 2. Sleep inertia and/or wakes up crying



> 3. Fatigue signs or a second wind before naps



> 4. Often easily falls asleep in the afternoon in a moving stroller in public or in a car



> 5. Difficulty getting out of bed and/or headaches in the morning



> When treating a sleep problem, the improvement in sleeping is sequential, not simultaneous. First, improvement will be seen for night sleep, then for the midmorning nap, and lastly for the midday nap. Improvement in night sleep may take only a few days, but improvement in naps may take longer.



> Because it is now out of character, rush to your child to make sure he is healthy. Most likely he will stop crying and smile at you when you arrive. Maintain silence, kiss him, and leave. No soothing. Your child is testing to see whether he can return to the old style. This is frustrating for parents because they misinterpret it as a failure or a setback. No, it is to be expected. Stay the course.



> Crying for more than forty-five minutes typically occurs only when your child is extremely fatigued from not napping well or a bedtime is too late.



> It should be emphasized that the treatment in this case did not involve aversive punishment. All that was done was to remove the reinforcement. Extinction of the tyrantlike tantrum behavior then occurred.



> One parent described extinction as follows: “Extinction is intended to be a carefully monitored, intentional method of refraining from further stimulating overstimulated and overtired babies in order to allow them to fulfill their need for sleep.” Q:



> A progressive (graduated) checking schedule means that you leave your baby for five minutes the first time he cries; when he next cries, you leave him for ten minutes, and the next time for fifteen minutes.



> Research has shown that graduated extinction takes about four to nine nights. Parents who do not see a rapid improvement usually do not have all the elements of self-soothing in place, and/or the bedtime is too late, and/or naps are not going well, and/or there is inconsistency in the approach to sleep.



> You quietly enter whenever your baby first cries to see that she is all right and gently soothe her in darkness, but you try to not pick her up. Instead, you rub her tummy, stroke her hair, or gently rock the crib. You do the least amount of rocking, singing, and, if necessary, nursing needed in order to soothe her back to a calm, sleepy state.



> Not surprisingly, the two factors that most likely predicted success were both parental: the absence of marital discord and the attendance of both parents at the consultation sessions. Also, when one problem such as resistance in going to sleep was reduced or resolved, other problems such as night waking rapidly disappeared.



> To make the transition from swing sleep to crib sleep, your general plan is to allow your baby to fall asleep in the moving swing and, once in a deep sleep, turn it off and leave him in it so he gets used to sleeping without the rocking. The next step is to transition him when in a deep sleep from the stationary swing to his crib. The next step is to not use the swing in the first place.



> A guideline is that if your child is allowed to sleep past 4:00 p.m. from a third nap, you may have difficulties with a bedtime that is in sync with her early night-sleep rhythm.



> By smell, babies know that Mom is gone, and they seem to protest less when Dad does the soothing to sleep. So consider starting the nap drill on a weekend, when Dad is available.



> Parents have less influence over naps for three reasons: 1. Parents are sometimes conflicted between naps and errands, scheduled events, visitors, and the needs of their other children during the day.



> 2. Nap rhythms develop around 3 to 4 months and naps become more predictable and longer around 6 months of age.



> 3. It is more light and noisy during the day, and your child may be outside or moving about in a carrier or stroller during nap time.



> When using extinction, graduated extinction, check and console, or some other sleep solution, your child may often start the day around 6:00 a.m. This is an approximate time: 5:30 a.m. or 6:30 a.m. might be the time for now. A mistake is to start the day much earlier, at 4:00 or 4:30 a.m., because your child awoke then and has difficulty returning to sleep.



> A reset is simply an extremely early bedtime that is strictly enforced for only one night to repay an accumulated sleep debt. Ignore all protests and excuses (extinction). Get him back in the good-sleep groove quickly. A reset might be done just a few times a year in some families,



> The reality, as with so much of parenting, is that you do the best you can. Your baby might need a 7:00 p.m. bedtime, but the best you can do is 8:00 p.m. This is still better than 9:00 p.m.! Life isn’t perfect, so don’t beat yourself up. Simply try for the earliest possible bedtime.



> Go to bed earlier yourself so you can enjoy morning time with your child. If you are not rushed, mornings may be filled with joy with your child: bathing, dressing, feeding, and playing together.



> I have dual-career parents in my practice who do not see their baby when they come home from work late but spend joyful time with their baby every morning and on weekends. Because everyone is always well rested, they accept this trade-off.



> Of course, parents might not see the deterioration of mood and behavior at 4:00–5:00 p.m. because they are at work. Furthermore, upon arrival home, the joy and pleasure of parent-child interaction, with games, stories, and comforting, might mask the child’s sleep-deprived state. These parents are skeptical that an earlier bedtime will help.



> With our 24-month-old, particularly over the last six months, we found that with super-early bedtimes (6:00–6:30 p.m.), we were getting waking in the 5:00–5:15 a.m. range. So we took the plunge and went to 7:00 p.m. We are full-on Weissbluth Method parents, so this was a big step for us! And the 7:00 p.m. change was successful…for about 4 weeks. Then her mood began to tank between 4:00 and 6:00 p.m.



> Research on 7-year-old children with irregular bedtimes or bedtimes later than 9:00 p.m. showed that they had more behavioral difficulties than children who had regular, earlier bedtimes. The effects of not having regular bedtimes appear to be reversible.



> sleep log is superior to a diary because a detailed diary, in which parents keep a minute-by-minute daily record of all the times their child is awake and asleep, is so focused on the small details that it becomes hard for parents to see the forest for the trees.



> Studying the sleep log allows you to pay closer attention to the timing of these events over several days and even weeks. The baseline data in these logs enable parents to compare interventions such as an earlier bedtime.



> Many children fall in love with their crib tent as if it were their personal hideaway—they seem to view it like a personal teepee or fort. They do not appear sad or angry. The crib tent is useful for families who know that they are unable or unwilling to do the silent-return-to-sleep routine when their child climbs out of the crib.



> Sleep Rules are a strategy I created that works well for children over 2½. The first step is to make a Sleep Rules poster and tape or pin it to the wall in your child’s bedroom. Just talking about what to do without the poster is much less effective. The poster is essential because it serves as a constant reminder for your child.



> Insert your child’s first name before the title so that John will listen carefully when a parent recites “John’s Sleep Rules” every time he is put to sleep. At every bedtime and nap time, recite the rules and explain the consequences. Sleep Rules should be implemented for both naps and nighttime sleep in order to be consistent.



> One, stay in bed; two, stay very quiet; three, close your eyes and keep them closed; and four, try to sleep.” ____________’S SLEEP RULES (insert your child’s name) 1. Stay in bed. 2. Be quiet. 3. Keep your eyes closed. 4. Try to sleep.



> Reward your child in the morning for compliance at night and immediately after a nap: a piece of candy, a cookie, wholesome snack foods, stickers, small toys, special events or trips, or more screen time (use a timer) in addition to hugs, kisses, and praise.



> I am sensitive to the fact that some people will claim that it is wrong to give something to a child to make a behavior occur—that it is like a bribe, which is given before the desired behavior. The simple answer is that we smile, hug, and praise our children after they perform in a socially desirable way.



> If your child is very young and you are not sure he understands the concept that actions have consequences, use the rewards alone and do not restrict privileges. But if your child is older and does understand, then restrict privileges for noncompliance: less light on in the bedroom, bedroom door is less open, less screen time, remove toys, and remove stuffed toys or other bed items.



> Remember, rewards are only half the story here. Think of what your child loves to do around the house and label it a privilege. Never restrict outdoor play and creative activities such as reading, painting, art, or building things. Rather, think of somewhat passive things, such as watching DVDs or television, playing video games on the computer, or perhaps playing with some favorite dolls or trucks.



> Silence when you take your baby back to bed is important, because if you are sweet or stern while trying to explain why everyone needs sleep, the verbal attention will reinforce your child’s desire to get out of bed to get more attention.



> Many parents do not understand that negative attention—even yelling or getting angry—is still attention, and it will encourage your child to continue the behavior.



> Q: My child is scared at night, and I don’t want to leave her alone. A: Try to spend extra time soothing her to sleep, buy a dream catcher or guardian angel to protect her, or go around the room catching all the monsters and put them in a bag that you take out of the room.



> A variant of the pass system, discussed above, is placing a bell by the child’s bed with the rule that the parents will respond promptly once, and only once, if the child rings the bell. Once the child learns that he can have his parents come to him at any time—but only once—he will use this power with restraint.



> you do not always rush to help a child struggling with a puzzle or accomplishing some task. When there is something that is slightly bothering your child, it is sometimes better to leave her alone to learn to deal with it.



> There are three important components to getting a child to go to sleep at night. The child must be: 1. Tired 2. Quiet 3. Relaxed When these three components are in place, children who have adequate “self-quieting skills” will be able to go to sleep rather easily.



> Self-quieting behaviors. The baby who goes to sleep with help from one of his or her parents by nursing, rocking, or holding learns only adult transition skills and needs an adult present in order to fall asleep.



> Even parents who choose co-sleeping can allow their infant or toddler the opportunity to fall asleep on their own, with the parent joining the child at the parents’ regular time for retiring. In this way, the infant or toddler gets the perceived advantages of co-sleeping and the known advantages of learning self-quieting skills.



> Here are a few techniques: 1. Progressive relaxation is a method whereby you tense individual skeletal muscle groups, release the tension, and focus on the resulting feeling of relaxation. 2. Biofeedback involves focusing on a visual or auditory stimulus that changes in proportion to the tension within skeletal muscles.



> 3. Self-suggestion to produce relaxation involves repeating suggestions that your arms and legs feel heavy and warm. 4. Paradoxical intention is based on the idea that trying hard to spontaneously fall asleep might create a vicious circle, which can be broken by focusing on staying awake. 5. Meditative relaxation procedures vary, but simple instructions to focus on the physical sensation of breathing seem to help some people fall asleep.



> Stimulus-control treatment tries to make the bedroom environment function as a cue for sleep. Spending lots of time in bed watching television, reading, or eating directly competes with sleeping, and therefore these activities must be discontinued. Temporal control means establishing a regular and healthy sleep schedule.



> Stimulus-Control Instructions 1. Lie down intending to go to sleep only when you are sleepy. 2. Do not use your bed for anything except sleep—that is, do not do homework, read, watch television, eat, or worry in bed. 3. If you find yourself unable to fall asleep, get up and go into another room.



> Parents’ responsibility in teaching sleep habits is the same as teaching other health habits such as hand-washing, tooth-brushing, or wearing a helmet when riding a bike. But there is no one-size-fits-all approach to helping children sleep well, because all families are different.



> One way to think about different sleep solutions and help you choose one is to organize them into three groups: 1. “No-cry” sleep solutions Teach self-soothing Many hands, father care Drowsy but awake, soothing Many naps Sleep log Bedtime routines Motionless sleep Sound machine, room-darkening curtains Positive routines plus faded bedtime with response cost Scheduled awakening Control the wake-up time Relaxation training Stimulus control 2. “Maybe-cry” sleep solutions Fade procedure Nap drill Parent-set bedtimes, regular bedtimes, earlier bedtimes Swings Crib tent Sleep Rules and silent return to sleep Pass system Day correction of bedtime problems 3. “Let-cry” sleep solutions Extinction: with or without cap, with or without parent presence Graduated extinction Check and console



> Parents have told me that the sleep solution that needs to be emphasized is many naps or brief intervals of wakefulness because it is not intuitively obvious that babies, who sleep so much, need to return to sleep within one to two hours after waking up.



> Some baby animals make sounds that always cause the mother to move closer to the baby animal; these have been called “proximity-promoting calls.” The obvious benefit for the baby animal is protection, nurturing, and not getting separated from the group. In infants, it is possible that crying originated as a similar signal that is no longer tightly linked to infant survival, but still occurs as a behavioral remnant of some distant past.



> The bad news was that attention to children twenty-four hours a day was thought to be good. Today’s “helicopter parents” are one result.



> Popular distortions of attachment theory claimed that a “twenty-four-hour parent”—meaning one who attends to every cry day and night—would produce a more securely attached child than would a “selfish” parent who ignores a cry at night so she can get some sleep. Accumulated scientific data do not support these claims.



> Extremely violent or catastrophic events aside, for ordinary families the power of past events has been extremely exaggerated, and the singular influence ascribed to the mother is unjustified.



> However, the editor in chief of Parents wrote in the October 1985 issue, after the birth of her third child: “The trick was that after eight years of parenthood, my husband and I have discovered…[that] the first sound does not mean that the baby needs to be picked up immediately.”



> the importance of mothers’ attentive holding of their child, he also emphasized that the capacity to be alone is one of the most important signs of maturity in emotional development. In his view, parents can facilitate the development of the child’s ability to soothe herself when left alone. Please don’t confuse this with abandonment or, on the other hand, use this notion as an excuse for negligence.



> the beginning of the separation-individuation process whereby the infant begins to differentiate from the mother at 4 to 5 months of age. This is the age when children naturally begin to develop some independence.



> Always going to your crying child at night interferes with this natural learning and growth. Such behavior produces sleep fragmentation, destroys sleep continuity, and creates insomnia in your child.



> This study suggests that crying for attention can be learned or taught by at least 6 months of age. I suspect that this learning can occur even earlier, so I encourage parents to try to be discriminating in their responses to their baby’s cries at night as early as possible.



> There has been much misunderstanding about “insecurity” and “crying to sleep” because of a failure to make the distinction between (1) the importance of sleeping well when we are in a biological sleep mode and (2) the importance of security of attachment when we are in a biological awake mode.



> However, insecurity of attachment as a concept makes no sense when the brain shifts to the sleep domain. When your child’s brain is in the sleep mode, he needs sleep and not more social interaction with parents.



> Contrary to Dr. Sears’s irresponsible opinions, scientific research has been published in peer-reviewed journals showing that extinction to help an infant or child sleep better does not cause harm. In fact, the opposite is true: after extinction, there are improvements in the mother, the child, and the bond between them.



> Cortisol levels after three days of “crying it out” on average showed no increase compared to before the sleep training program began. Further, the cortisol level on the fourth day was less than the third day (personal communication).



> My observations and sound scientific data show that if children are well rested during the day, and if the bedtime is early enough to prevent a second wind, and if parents do not reinforce the crying by going in to comfort the child, then crying occurring with extinction lasts only a few days, after which the entire family enjoys the physical and psychological benefits of more sleep.



> It is smart, not selfish, for the mother to take breaks without guilt to recharge her battery, because she is the power source of most of the soothing effort.



> Parents who favor a more gradual approach (check-and-console or graduated extinction) over an abrupt approach (extinction) often complain of frequent “relapses.” The general reason a gradual approach tends to be less successful in the long run is that it takes longer and there are always natural disruptions of sleep, such as illnesses or vacations.



> Several days of a gradual approach often wear down parents, so they give up and revert to their old inconsistencies. Parents who have successfully used extinction know that they might have one, and only one, nasty reentry night of crying



> This is why a sleep log can be an important tool to help document what you are really doing and how your child is really responding. After all, short-term “successes” might only reflect brief periods when your child crashes at night from chronic exhaustion.



> Parents often fear that an earlier bedtime will automatically produce an earlier wake-up time that is inconvenient for them. This usually does not occur because an earlier bedtime produces a better-sleeping child who is more able to self-soothe, even in the very early morning hours. This is why sleep begets sleep.



> there are indirect benefits for the family as well: the stay-at-home mother doesn’t have to deal with a “witching hour” in the late afternoon, and no “witching hour” means the father comes home from work to a calm, well-rested mother; both parents have relaxed private time in the evenings and overnight, which strengthens the marriage; the child is raised by well-rested parents.



> But this single super-early bedtime might be employed several times a year because of frequent grandparent visits or illnesses. Be firm. So the bedtime is not a fixed clock time but is moved earlier when needed, then readjusted later again to keep your child well rested, which is the overall goal.



> Don’t fret about naps or night sleep on a day-to-day or night-to-night basis. It will drive you crazy. That is missing the forest for the trees. When starting a sleep solution, be patient with your plan, and remember that it may take several days or several weeks before you see the benefits.



> There is enormous variation among families regarding teamwork, number of rooms, the presence or absence of colic, and so forth. Don’t compare your child to other children; just focus on your own child.



> Regular sleep schedules in general help anchor healthy sleep. But don’t be a slave to a sleep schedule. Exceptions to your sleep plan, such as skipping naps or staying up late for holidays or special occasions, are fine once or twice a month, but not much more often.



> The four spokes of the Sleep Wheel support the rim: 1. Start early 2. Many hands (get Dad and others on board) 3. Put your child down while drowsy but awake 4. Many naps (no cumulative sleepiness, no second wind)



> beginning with the evening bedtime. 1. At 6 weeks of age (all ages are counted from the due date), an early bedtime develops.



> 2. Consolidated night sleep develops before or between 6 and 9 months of age, when babies no longer need to be fed at night.



> 3. Wake-up time is not too early.



> 4. The midmorning nap is regular but initially brief and develops around 3–4 months of age.



> 5. The midday nap is regular but initially brief and develops shortly after the midmorning nap.



> 6. Late afternoon nap(s) tend(s) to be irregular and brief. They usually disappear by 9 months of age.



> Usually, three days later the child would be falling asleep faster, the total night-sleep duration would be slightly longer, and the mother’s report would be, to her surprise, that her child was now even sweeter, calmer, more alert, and more patient between 4:00 and 5:00 p.m. than before. Skepticism about this scenario is a normal response.



> A contributing factor in today’s rush to “improve my child” is that parents’ challenges have increased in modern times. There are more mothers in the workforce and away from their children (contributing to so-called working mother’s guilt); the global economy means that there are more people competing for fewer good jobs; parents want more educational activities for their children because there is more information available and more facts to be learned.



> If you are skeptical that sleep is more important than another lesson, class, or sports activity, talk to a disinterested party such as your pediatrician, a child psychologist or child psychiatrist, or a specialist in early child development.



> My position is that sleep is of vital importance and well-rested children soak up knowledge like a dry sponge. Colors are more vivid, sounds are more interesting, smells and tastes are more exciting. Life and being with others is more enjoyable. Sleepy children experience a drabber, duller world, as through a glass darkly.



> My observation is that when parents routinely keep their child well rested, then that child is more able to deal with occasional sleep disruptions such as classes or family outings. But



> Many fathers want to cooperate with helping their child sleep, but only in the sense that they will do what their wife tells them to do. They expect her to be the leader in all things related to child rearing and view themselves as the helpful follower. This does not work for finding and successfully executing a sleep solution when the mother is very sleep deprived.



> One area of research, based on animal studies, is how the mother’s biological rhythms may help set or influence the rhythms of the fetus and the newborn baby: based on the regularity or irregularity of the mother’s sleep/wake patterns, activity/rest patterns, or eating patterns, there may be a kind of prenatal programming affecting the baby’s own rhythms.



> Babies quickly become overtired after only one or two hours of wakefulness, and some cannot comfortably stay up for even one hour! During the day, note the time when your baby wakes up and try to help her nap by soothing within the next one or two hours, before she becomes overtired.



> Always respond to your baby when you think your baby is hungry or in distress. Avoid the overtired state by keeping the intervals of wakefulness brief. •



> Newborn: The First Week Night sleep: No established rhythms Day sleep: No established rhythms Bedtimes: No established rhythms



> Full-term babies sleep a lot during the first several days; pre-term babies sleep even more, while post-term babies sleep less. For a few days, full-term babies eat very little and often lose weight. This is all very natural and should not alarm you.



> Why, then, have you heard that you should not let your child fall asleep during soothing or feeding? The theory is that your child needs to learn self-soothing skills, and that she will not learn these skills if she comes to associate soothing or feeding with sleep.



> Now, when you soothe and feed your baby, you discover that she will not be easily placed in her crib or stay asleep unless she is already in a deep sleep at the end of the soothing and feeding. Soothing herself to sleep is difficult because she develops a second wind or she belongs to the 20 percent of babies (those afflicted with extreme fussiness/colic) who are often this way during the first few months.



> Weeks 2 to 4: More Fussiness Night sleep: No established rhythms Day sleep: No established rhythms Bedtimes: No established rhythms



> Do not expect your baby to adhere to a schedule because the baby’s needs for food, cuddling, and sleeping are going to occur erratically and unpredictably. When your baby needs to be fed, feed him; when he needs to have his diaper changed, change him; and when he needs to sleep, allow him to sleep.



> Studies have shown that for babies a few weeks old, the longest single sleep period may be only three to four hours, and it can occur at any time during the day or night.



> Parenting strategies such as changes in the amount of light or noise don’t appear to greatly influence babies’ sleep patterns at this stage. In fact, specific styles or methods of burping, changing, or feeding do not seem to really affect the baby at all. Try not to think of doing things to or for the baby. Instead, take time to enjoy doing things with your baby.



> Here are some concrete steps you can take to make it easier for everyone: 1. Take naps during the day when your baby is sleeping. 2. Turn off all phones in the house when your baby is sleeping. 3. Go out, without your baby, for breaks: a walk, a coffee date, or a movie. 4. Plan or arrange for a few hours of private time to take care of yourself.



> At any age, if parents attend to these normal arousals too frequently or provide too much intervention, the child may develop a night-crying or night-feeding habit. This becomes a sleep problem called signaling, and because it fragments both the child’s and parent’s sleep, the result is a sleep-deprived family.



> When will my child sleep through the night? A: After 6 weeks, infants tend to go to sleep earlier, around 6:00 to 8:00 p.m., and most need to be fed before they wake up to start the day. The need for night feedings disappears slowly over the next several months.



> During these spells of unexplainable restlessness or fussiness, your baby may swallow air and become gassy. Often he appears to be in pain. Sometimes he cries and you can’t figure out why. The crying baby may be hungry or just fussy. This is confusing and frustrating to all parents.



> keep in mind that your child will have a little, a medium amount, or a lot of unexplained fussiness and crying that is likely to first increase, then decrease after 6 weeks (counting from the due date), and then disappear more or less completely around 2–4 months of age.



> They found that most of the newborns cried between one and eleven minutes per hour for the duration of their stay in the nursery. The average daily total duration of crying was about two hours for these seventy-two babies. All of the infants cried for some time every day.



> Researchers found that the minimum amount of crying per day in this group was 48 minutes and the maximum amount was 243 minutes. All of the infants cried some of the time—at least forty-eight minutes per day. The average duration of crying was, as before, about two hours per day.



> The researchers attempted to classify the causes of crying: hunger, vomiting, wet or soiled diapers, and unknown reasons.



> They found that hunger appeared to cause 36 percent of all time spent crying. Wet diapers caused about 21 percent of crying time, and soiled diapers about 8 percent. Specifically interesting was that 35 percent of all time spent crying was due to “unknown reasons.” The researchers were surprised that such a large part of crying—over one-third—could not be explained by any obvious causes.



> The babies averaged four crying spells a day. All babies had some crying spells. Fifty-five percent of these spells were attributed to hunger. Crying associated with vomiting, stooling, urination, overheating, bathing, chilling, lights, or noises (the mothers making these attributions) were individually less common than crying for unknown reasons.



> Dr. Brazelton also found that crying spells became much more focused or concentrated in the evening by the time the infants were about 6 weeks of age, when the crying peaked. By this time, very little crying occurred during the day.



> This is not to diminish the distress caused to parents because of their inability to deal with this crying. That difficulty cannot be overstated. Government data have shown that infant homicides increase after the second week and peak at the eighth week,



> Because sucking is soothing to infants, some parents misattribute the “fussing”



> state to hunger and vigorously attempt to feed their baby. These parents may misinterpret their infants as having a “growth spurt” at 6 weeks because they were “hungry” all the time, especially in the evening.



> Immediately after delivery, concentrations of serotonin are higher at night and lower during the day. Melatonin, flowing across the placenta from the mother, causes high concentrations immediately after birth, but they rapidly fall to extremely low levels within several days.



> Serotonin and melatonin have opposite effects on the muscle around the gut—serotonin causes contraction, melatonin causes relaxation. Linda Weissbluth’s theory is that in some infants, high serotonin levels cause painful gastrointestinal cramps in the evening, when serotonin concentrations are at their highest.



> Twenty percent of babies have extreme fussiness/colic, and the parents of these babies are unlucky. These babies require a lot of parental soothing. They tend not to be self-soothing, and they often appear intense, seem agitated, and have difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep.



> Feedings may be long and frequent because in addition to satisfying thirst and hunger, much of the nursing is non-nutritive sucking to reduce fussiness. When these babies are extremely fussy, methods of soothing other than breast-feeding often do not work.



> If you want to breast-feed, a compromise position is to have someone else give a single bottle of expressed breast or formula once per twenty-four hours.



> Although the mother’s sleep may be fragmented by frequent feeding for both nutrition and soothing, this is probably the most powerful soothing method for these babies.



> There is some research to suggest that parents who make the commitment to use the family bed from day one and stick with it will wind up with better-rested babies than those parents who initially wanted to use the crib but later brought their baby into their bed because it was the only way they could get any sleep.



> Also, this report suggests that over time, between the ages of 5 and 9 weeks, sleep duration increased among extremely fussy/colicky infants. Based on the sleep lab data and ignoring the parent diary data, the authors concluded that infantile colic was not associated with a sleep disorder.



> criteria. So, although the prevalence varies with the definition, about 20 percent is a common ballpark figure in



> The fundamental reason these treatments do not work for excessive fussiness/colic is that these children do not have a diagnosable medical problem. Excessive fussiness/colic is something some infants do; it is not a condition that they have. Think of caring for these infants and for yourself, not of searching for a cure. Caring involves getting help to take breaks without guilt and doing whatever you can to help prevent crying and fussing.



> My nurse, who was also a mother, was holding the baby chest to chest, with the baby’s head resting on her right shoulder. The nurse’s right cheek was gently pressed into the baby’s right cheek, and the nurse gently rocked her body both from side to side and also with a slow and slightly rotational movement. It looked like my nurse was dancing with the baby in slow motion. The nurse was also whispering or shushing or humming directly into the child’s right ear. Needless to say, we were all pleasantly surprised that the crying had abruptly stopped; in fact, we realized that the baby was now sound asleep.



> struck me that some mothers might have better soothing skills than other mothers and that the notion of inconsolability might, in part, reflect a mother’s ability or inability to soothe.



> Maternal depression may be caused by a child who is not sleeping well (Chapter 2) and may lead to unnecessary nighttime feedings or interventions that result in sleep fragmentation, causing a sleep-deprived baby to exhibit colic-like behavior



> But mothers told me that fathers were highly involved or not involved at all in parenting before the colic developed, and the trend of fathers to be less involved in helping the child sleep well (from 92 percent to 70 percent) was a source of great stress for the marriage and for parenting in general.



> I began to wonder whether the lack of involvement of the father in caring for the baby and his lack of teamwork in the marriage might be contributing to sleep deprivation in the baby and mother so that colicky behavior emerged.



> Obviously, children’s sleep issues reflect not only the mother’s care for the baby but also the father’s care and how well the parents cooperate or agree on parenting. An uninvolved, absent, abusive, or addicted husband or father may adversely affect a mother’s mental health and a child’s sleep.



> I would also have made sure that I protected her naps and bedtime from day one. I also would have made sure that Dad was more involved and on the same page from day one.



> “Most [proximal care] infants continue to wake their parents at night when 10 months of age.”



> If you suspect that your baby has extreme fussiness/colic, do everything you can to maximize sleep and minimize crying during the first weeks. Parents who are able to put forth heroic efforts to soothe their fussy baby may note that there is really minimal or no crying, only fussing.



> The most important thing to remember is that you will be more successful in soothing your baby and surviving your baby’s colic if you get help in order to take breaks. Also remember: this, too, shall pass.



> Teamwork and constant communication between parents is the bedrock that permits a family to cope with and emerge from colic well rested. Starting early and tolerating some crying is common in some situations, and no adverse effects occur:



> All babies experience unexplained fussiness and crying in their first weeks of life, no matter what your ethnic group, no matter what birthing method brought your child into the world, no matter if your lifestyle is that of jet-setter or stay-at-home parent.



> Starting at 4 weeks, I would just put him down in his room when he was tired [that is, drowsy but awake]. He would cry for five to ten minutes, and then sleep a full nap. If I had tried holding or rocking him, he would have screamed for a long, long time without sleeping.



> In the first 4 months, we were lucky to get four to five hours of consolidated sleep in a day. Most days, it was two to three hours. Add to that dealing with a fussy child almost around the clock, and you have a recipe for frazzled and distressed parents.



> At first his naps were short, forty-five minutes or so. After a few weeks the midmorning nap lengthened to about an hour and a half, the midday nap went from forty-five minutes to an hour, and the third nap declined to about thirty-five minutes.



> You are doing what is best for your baby. It seems cruel and unacceptable, as a loving new mother, to let your baby cry. But it is a fact of parenting—many, many things will bring tears and protests in the years to come.



> When babies cry at night they are not lonely, afraid, and anxious or any of the other things they might be when they are awake; when babies cry at night, they are tired.



> First night: cried intermittently for seventy-five minutes Second night: twenty-five minutes Third night: forty-five minutes Fourth night: fifteen minutes Fifth night: done! She goes down without a fight and sleeps like a baby—or, shall I say, like a baby is supposed to sleep! We wished we’d done this sooner.



> think many new parents get stuck in the fog and can’t bear to hear their babies cry. While it does take a degree of courage, my husband and I were astounded by how quickly our baby learned to soothe herself to sleep.



> Begin to teach your baby self-soothing: many hands (enlisting the help of the father and others), putting your baby down drowsy but awake, and many naps



> Develop bedtime routines and avoid unnecessary feedings or interventions at night.



> When babies fuss or cry, they do not sleep. When they do not sleep, mothers do not sleep. Mind-numbing fatigue from lack of sleep is your main enemy!



> More fussing and crying will develop in all babies. Fussing occurs more than crying. Fussiness is a pre-cry state that will often change into crying if parents are unable to soothe their baby; some fussing leads to crying despite parents’ soothing efforts.



> If you have not already begun, start to teach your child self-soothing, develop bedtime routines, and avoid unnecessary feedings or interventions at night. There are still no established biological rhythms for night sleep, day sleep, or bedtime, so you should continue to watch for drowsy signs.



> If teaching self-soothing is not working, or if you think your child is developing extreme fussiness/colic, then temporarily abandon efforts to teach self-soothing. You cannot spoil your 2- to 4-week-old baby, so do whatever you can to maximize sleep and minimize fussing and crying.



> Weeks 5 and 6 Night sleep: More evening fussiness may be associated with less night sleep before 6 weeks; after 6 weeks, night-sleep rhythms emerge Day sleep: Naps are brief and irregular; there may be many catnaps Bedtimes: Bedtimes are irregular and may occur late, between 9:00 and 11:00 p.m.



> And if they do not help, do whatever works to maximize sleep and minimize crying: swings, strollers, car rides, or sleep at Mom’s breast or on Dad’s chest. Exhaustion is your main enemy, so get help in order to take breaks.



> some but not all brief naps might be extended by reswaddling, a quick feeding, or replacing a pacifier. Swaddling and pacifiers might help; they will not harm your baby and should not be viewed as a “crutch” that somehow interferes with learning self-soothing.



> About 6 weeks of age (counting from the due date), around the time your baby produces her first social smiles, night sleep becomes more organized, and the longest single sleep period begins to occur with predictability and regularity in the evening hours.



> Your baby will also start to settle down more and more. She will become more interested in objects such as mobiles and toys, she’ll have more interest in playing games, and her repertoire of emotional expressions and social responses will dramatically increase.



> Antonio is now almost 5 months old, and he has been sleeping from 6:30 p.m. through the night to about 7:00 a.m. He has been doing this since he was 12 weeks old. He does wake up occasionally at 4:00 or 5:00 a.m. if he’s hungry, but for the most part he sleeps extremely well at night,



> Being annoyed with your baby does not make you a “bad” parent. Just understand why you’re annoyed. Remember that your baby’s immature nervous system lacks inhibitory control: your baby might have moments of tremulousness, quivering, or shaking of the arms or legs.



> Weeks 7 and 8 Night sleep: Becoming organized Day sleep: Naps are brief and irregular; there may be many catnaps Bedtime: Starting to be earlier



> The major biological changes starting now are a tendency for your baby to go to sleep earlier at night and for longer periods of uninterrupted night sleep.



> Prepare yourself for changes resulting from your child’s increased social maturation. The social smiles herald the onset of increased social awareness, and it may come to pass that your baby will now start to fight sleep in order to enjoy the pleasure of your company. This is natural!



> Truly, I believe that in the case of a colicky baby, who in most cases cannot be treated for her condition, it is the mother who “needs treatment” or help, and to this end I suggest: 1. Get out of the house an hour or two a day, minimum. 2. When out of the house, try to get some physical exercise to burn off the tension.



> 3. Don’t feel guilty about doing anything that makes you feel good. 4. Socialize as much as possible outside the home. 5. Keep a diary or log of your baby’s sleeping/feeding habits. 6. When the baby is asleep, get some sleep yourself, unless you’re doing something for your own peace of mind.



> brain matures predictably in three ways: 1. Specific responsive social smiling. When you smile at her, she returns your smile. 2. Longer sleep periods (four to six hours) occurring predictably in the evening hours, usually before midnight. This is part of the night-sleep circadian rhythm. 3. The brain wants to fall asleep earlier in the evening.



> In fact, the early development of regular, long night-sleep periods—starting well before the age of 6 weeks—is a characteristic feature of “easy” babies. These kids are very portable, and parents bask in their sunny dispositions.



> In fact, the quiet evenings might now be punctured by new, “painful” cries suggesting an illness. Or it might now take longer to put the baby to sleep. What has happened to your sound sleeper? Irregularities of sleep schedules, nap deprivation, and too late a bedtime are the chief culprits. Now is the time to become ever more sensitive to your child’s need to sleep.



> You should try to reestablish healthy sleep habits by removing the disruptive effects of external noises, lights, or vibrations. Although it may be inconvenient for you, try to have your baby back in her crib after no more than two hours of wakefulness.



> Q: How long can I keep my baby up? A: No more than two hours. Two hours of wakefulness is about the maximum that most babies can endure without becoming overtired.



> Try to soothe him to sleep before he becomes overtired—before he becomes slightly crabby, seems irritable, pulls his hair, or bats at his ears. Expect this type of behavior to develop within two hours of waking up if he is not put to sleep when he first shows signs of being tired.



> In Dr. R. S. Illingworth’s review, colicky behavior ends in 50 percent of afflicted babies by 2 months of age, in an additional 30 percent by 3 months of age, and in an additional 10 percent by 4 months of age. So you might try to help your baby with extreme fussiness/colic sleep better with drowsy but awake, an earlier bedtime, and graduated extinction, extinction with a cap, or extinction for a four-to-five-day trial and be successful before 4 months of age.



> following hints will help you get through these first few months. Helpful Tips for Parents Pamper yourself; remember, this is smart for the baby, not selfish for you.



> Forget errands, chores, housework.



> Unplug the phone. Ignore your baby’s quiet vocalizations during sleep. Nap when baby sleeps. Hire help for housework or breaks when your baby is most bothersome. Plan pleasurable, brief outings without your baby



> Tips to Help Soothe Babies Definitely helpful in soothing: Rhythmic rocking: in chair swing, arms, car rides Sucking: pacifier, thumb, wrist Gentle pressure: swaddling, massage Gentle sounds: lullabies, music, singing, humming Possibly helpful in soothing: Lambskin rug Warm-water bottle placed on abdomen Recordings of heartbeat sound, womb sounds, vacuum cleaner, running water, sounds of nature Removal of stimulating



> Some babies nap best in a pitch-black and/or very quiet room



> Placing a soft, tiny blanket in baby’s hand



> You can’t treat colic with smiles, but there will be less crying in a home where there is a lot of social smiling. Practice smiling, smile broadly, open your eyes wide, regard your child as you nod, and say “Good boy” or “Good girl.” Do all these especially when your baby calms down or smiles at you. Even if your child does not always respond to your smiles, this practice, like a rehearsal, will pay off big-time later.



> So between 2 and 4 months, your baby should begin to appear calmer in the early evening and to sleep better at night. If you have not done so already, now is the time to practice letting your child learn more self-soothing



> More smiles, coos, giggles, laughs, and squeals light up your life. Your child is now a more social creature. She is sleeping better at night, but naps may still be brief and irregular.



> In addition to your presence, which provides pleasurable stimulation, your baby’s increasing curiosity about all the new and exciting parts of her expanding world may disrupt her sleep.



> When your baby needs to sleep, try to have her in an environment where she will sleep well. As she continues to grow, she will become more curious and social, and you will notice that she probably naps best in her crib.



> Now you must become sensitive to the difference in quality between brief, interrupted daytime sleep and prolonged, consolidated naps. As your child’s biological rhythms evolve for day sleep, your general goal is to synchronize your soothing-to-sleep activities with her internal timing mechanism for sleep.



> Many children are overtired from not napping well or from going to sleep too late. They may not nap well because they’re getting too much outside stimulation, too much handling, or too much irregular handling.



> An awareness of sleep inertia will help you decide whether a particular nap was long enough. And sensitivity to the witching hour will help you determine whether naps on a particular day were long enough



> The two-hour limit on wakefulness is an approximation. Often there is a magic moment of tiredness when the baby will go to sleep easily. She is tired then but not overtired. If you go past this point in time, expect fatigue to set in. When your baby is up too long, she will tend to become overstimulated, overaroused, irritable, or peevish from a second wind



> Why focus on the midmorning nap? Simply because it develops before the midday nap. Try to teach self-soothing for the midmorning nap and then do whatever works to maximize sleep and minimize fussing/crying for the remainder of the day (being mindful to limit wakefulness to short intervals).



> Each night she cried less and less, and I handled it better and better. After a week, her hysteria was gone! Sure, she cried a little sometimes, but now she was on a schedule. She napped two or three times a day, two to four hours at a time, and slept twelve to fifteen hours a night. Sleeping promotes more sleep, and makes it easier to fall asleep.



> Letting your baby “cry it out” is not the only way your baby will learn to nap. Babies and children learn to nap well when parents focus on timing, motionless sleep (sleep in a crib or stationary stroller, as opposed to sleep while in a moving car or stroller), and consistency in soothing style.



> After a few days of life, the sleepy brain wakes up, and during the first 6 weeks of life infants display increasing amounts of fussiness, crying, or agitated wakefulness, during which they swallow air and become gassy. At 6 weeks (or 6 weeks after the due date) the duration of these periods peaks, and they become more common in the evening hours.



> At about 6 weeks of age, something dramatic occurs naturally: your baby begins to produce social smiles, and the evening fussiness begins to decrease in most babies. One mother asked me if she could “fast-forward to 6 weeks” and skip the hard part. Sorry! But from 6 weeks, a more predictable and longer midmorning nap will emerge.



> Night sleep usually develops without problems at 6 weeks of age because: 1. Darkness serves as a time cue. 2. We slow down our activities and become quieter at night. 3. We behave as if we expect our baby to sleep.



> There are three factors that will help your baby sleep well during the day: timing, motionless sleep, and consistency in soothing style.



> I repeat: crying is the consequence of becoming overtired. At this particular time, your efforts to soothe—hugging, rocking, talking—may be stimulating and interfere with the natural surfacing of the sleep process. After all, your baby does not fall asleep immediately in the same way a light switch is turned off. Rather, the sleep process takes time.



> Temporarily, her baby was put to sleep at a very early time, between 5:30 and 6:00 p.m. The plan was to help the child get more sleep at night and be asleep before a second wind developed. The mother was to soothe her baby at night and then either lie down with him or put him in his crib.



> Because of the baby’s age, and because he had been extremely fussy/colicky, and because he had become accustomed to sleeping with his mother in her bed at the breast, we knew he would protest our plan. We decided that we would ignore his protest crying at the onset of sleep and would use the father to soothe him at night when he might cry but was not hungry. During the day, the mother would do whatever worked to maximize sleep and minimize crying to keep him as well rested as possible.



> Falling asleep is simply learned behavior, a habit. The important thing is that the behavior is learned, not how it is learned. Your child will learn best if you are consistent in how you soothe him to sleep for naps.



> Method A: At nap time your baby sometimes soothes himself to sleep unassisted. After soothing your baby for several minutes, you always put him down to sleep whether or not he is asleep. You are practicing putting him down for a nap drowsy but awake.



> Contrary to popular belief, your child will not develop night-sleep problems if you include breast-feeding as part of the soothing process. Also contrary to popular belief, it is not necessary that you always put him down fully awake.



> Method B: Your baby always begins naps with your help. You always hold and soothe your baby until she is in a deep sleep state, no matter how long it takes.



> decisive; choose a soothing style and be consistent. Consistency helps your baby sleep better, because, as noted above, the process of falling asleep is a learned behavior.



> Day-sleep organization develops at 3 to 4 months of age. A regularly occurring midmorning nap appears first, followed by a regularly occurring midday nap a few or several weeks later.



> Please begin to be consistent around 6 weeks of age, when your child is clearly becoming more social and everyone is getting more rest at night. For babies born before their due date, these changes occur about 6 weeks after the due date, and that is when you should start.



> had a rule: If she was sleepy and not crying (even at a few days old), she was to be put in her bassinet. We still played with her and enjoyed her, but we were not walking around the house with her twenty-four hours a day.



> Here are some common nap mistakes: Keeping the intervals of wakefulness too long Using swings, cars, or strollers during naps too much with older children Inconsistency in methods used to soothe your baby to sleep



> So while it is socially limiting to plan ahead and protect naps, it is liberating to have a well-rested child who never fusses or cries during the day at home or in public. An early bedtime with consolidated night sleep is also liberating for parents, who can enjoy calm private time together early in the evening and overnight.



> healthy sleep depends on different but interrelated elements (see Chapter 1): Sleep duration Naps Sleep consolidation Sleep schedule, timing of sleep Sleep regularity When all the pieces are considered, healthy sleep will be accomplished.



> Studies by Dr. C. Anderson Aldrich have shown that all babies have some uncategorizable crying: that is, they cry for no apparent reason. From studies by Dr. Ian St. James-Roberts, we know that no matter what the parenting style, bouts of inconsolable crying can occur.



> One father called this “tag-team parenting” because whenever one parent became exhausted, the other one took over for car rides, walks, or trips in the stroller to let the other get some much-needed rest. Two exhausted parents don’t make a good couple!



> The three maneuvers are: 1. Rhythmic motions:



> 2. Sucking: at breast, bottle, fist, wrist, thumb, or pacifier.



> 3. Swaddling:



> Practice showering affection on your baby, even when he’s crying. This loving attention is important for both of you.



> It cannot be overemphasized that, as stated by Dr. A. H. Parmelee, “parents are never truly prepared for the degree to which the babies’ sleep/wake patterns will dominate and completely disrupt their daily activities.”



> After about 4 months of age, most parents have learned to differentiate between their child’s need for consolidated sleep and the child’s preference for soothing, pleasurable company at night. Most parents can learn to appreciate that prolonged, uninterrupted sleep is a health habit they can influence; they can quickly learn to stop reinforcing night wakings and irregular nap schedules that rob kids of needed rest.



> Dr. Thomas noted interrelations among four temperament characteristics: mood, intensity, adaptability, and approach/withdrawal.



> four additional temperament characteristics were described: persistence, activity, distractibility, and threshold. Threshold means how sensitive or insensitive the child appears to be to noises or changes in lighting.



> Below are the nine infant-temperament characteristics described by Drs. Thomas and Chess. 1. Activity (general motion, energy).



> Activity levels in infants have nothing to do with “hyperactivity” in older children. 2. Rhythmicity (regularity of bodily functions). Rhythmicity is a measure of how regular or predictable the infant appears.



> Some babies are very regular at age 2 months, while others seem to be irregular throughout the first year. As infants grow older, they tend to become more regular in their habits. 3. Approach/withdrawal (first reaction). Approach/withdrawal is a temperament characteristic that defines the infant’s initial reaction to something new.



> Some infants reach out in new circumstances—accept, appear curious, approach—others object, reject, turn away, appear shy, or withdraw.



> 4. Adaptability (flexibility). Adaptability is measured by observing such activities as whether the infant accepts nail cutting without protest, accepts bathing without resistance, accepts changes in feeding schedule, accepts strangers within fifteen minutes, and accepts new foods.



> 5. Intensity. Intensity is the degree or amount of an infant’s response, either pleasant or unpleasant.



> 6. Mood. If intensity is the degree of response, mood is the direction. It is measured in the same situations described above.



> 7. Persistence. Persistence level, or attention span, is a measure of how long the infant engages in activity. Parents



> 8. Distractibility. Distractibility describes how easily the baby may be distracted by external events. Picking up the infant easily consoles a distractible infant’s fatigue or hunger; soothing can stop fussing during a diaper change.



> 9. Threshold (sensitivity). Threshold levels measure how much stimulus is required to produce a response in the infant in specific circumstances, such as loud noises, bright lights, and other situations previously discussed.



> These infants also tended to be irregular in biological function such as sleep schedules and night awakenings. They were more likely to have behavioral problems—particularly sleep disturbances—when they grew older.



> The crying of the difficult-temperament infants was found to have more silent pauses between crying sounds than that of the easy babies. These silent pauses caused the listener to repeatedly think that the crying spell had ended.



> Alternatively, parents who put their baby to sleep slightly too late, or who often cause their children to skip naps after 4 months of age, keep their post-colic infant close to the edge of overtiredness.



> Some post-colic kids are extremely active; they appear to have boundless energy. “She



> They appear easily bored; they also seem very stimulus-sensitive, especially to mechanical noises



> They may remain very active but less frantic, and this suggests that whatever biologic process may be contributing to high activity behavior, lack of sleep is also part of the picture. When they’ve had enough sleep, these same babies appear to have boundless curiosity, actively seeking opportunities to learn.



> Although nine infant-temperament characteristics were measured, only five are used to establish the diagnosis of a difficult temperament. And four of these (mood, adaptability, rhythmicity, and approach/withdrawal) were individually highly associated with total sleep duration.



> When this study was extended to include 105 infants, those infants with difficult temperaments slept 12.8 hours and those with easy temperaments slept 14.9 hours.



> the difficult temperament at 4 to 5 months simply represents an overtired infant whose parents were unable to establish healthy sleep.



> At 4 weeks of age, infants who were temperamentally more difficult in general, and more intense and less distractible (less consolable) in particular, cried more during their second month of life than other infants.



> This strongly suggests that there is a mother-related component underlying the behavior called extreme fussiness/colic, because when mothers were armed with more information on how to soothe their babies, there was less crying.



> Therefore, it appears that the increased crying/fussing behavior in infancy is associated with less infant sleep and more signaling at night (fragmented sleep), but the crying/fussing alone does not directly cause later sleep problems.



> Without your effort to maintain sleep schedules, your child will have a tendency to sleep irregularly and become unmanageably wild, screaming out of control with the slightest frustration and spending most of the day engaged in crazy, demanding, and impatient behaviors.



> Two or more months of crying sometimes adversely and permanently shapes parenting styles. An inconsolable infant triggers in some parents a perception that their baby’s behavior is out of their control. They observe no obvious benefit to their young extremely fussy/colicky child when they try to be regular according to clock times or to be consistent in bedtime routines.



> In some nonindustrial societies and among parents practicing proximal care (attachment parenting), babies rarely cry, because they are always held close to the mother in a soft carrier, highlighting the role of the mother. However, even where there is constant holding and unrestricted breast-feeding throughout the day and night, babies still cry and fuss, which supports the notion of a baby-driven path.



> Temperament assessments, performed at an average age of 3.6 months, showed an association between problems of sleep/wake organization, difficult temperament, and extreme crying. Mothers of crying infants scored high on depression, anxiety, exhaustion, anger, adverse childhood memories, and marital distress



> But for those 5-month-olds with long sleep durations and easy temperaments who also had long sleep durations at age 3 years, the easy temperament persisted. Sleep modulates temperament!



> If parents make the effort to manage their kids’ sleep schedules consistently, I would think that over the years they are going to see less difficult and unmanageable behavior.”



> I also believe that at 5 months of age, the difficult temperament represents an overtired baby and the easy temperament represents a well-rested baby.



> Research—both my own and others’—has shown that about 80 percent of babies develop common fussiness/crying and 20 percent develop extreme fussiness/colic.



> Parents’ inability to soothe may grow out of, or be a response to, the fatigue, frustration, and exhaustion of trying, without much success, to soothe an extremely fussy/colicky baby.



> As Cindy Crawford says in the foreword, “The most important thing is a well-rested family.” The goal is to develop a caring environment for the family, not a cure for extreme fussiness/colic.



> At 3 to 4 months, your baby will start to show drowsy signs earlier in the evening. Instead of becoming sleepy at 8:00 to 10:00 p.m., she will become sleepy at 6:00 to 8:00 p.m.



> Many mothers dropped out of the study, but the 560 mothers who stayed were more likely to be married, have completed more formal education, have higher household incomes, be nonsmokers, breast-feed, and have “higher levels of social support.”



> baby might be placed in a crib close to the side of your bed. Later, the crib is moved a few inches from your bed. Gradually the crib is moved farther away until it is in baby’s room.



> I believe that the quality of your baby’s sleep influences the development of temperament at 4 to 6 months of age. And how babies sleep during the first few months is a combination of factors within the child and the parents’ ability and skill at soothing.



> children’s personality may be severely and adversely affected when they are short of sleep, but the good news is that these changes are reversible!



> The foundation for the midday nap is the midmorning nap, just as the foundation for the midmorning nap is night sleep. Gradually, for all children, naps will become more predictable and longer. Attempts to extend naps by reswaddling, replacing a pacifier, or offering a quick feeding may help.



> Routines that comfort your baby, including rocking, soft blankets, lullabies, stroking, patting, and cuddling for bedtime (see Chapter 3), may also be used intact or modified for nap time.



> your baby down drowsy but awake? There are many well-rested 4-month-old children with self-soothing skills who often fall asleep with nursing.



> It will become more difficult to change your baby’s sleep patterns after about 6 months of age because of the development of self-agency. Self-agency means that your child can express likes and dislikes with greater energy and persistence than previously. If your infant wants to reach a desired toy, she may persist longer in trying to get it into her grasp.



> Uninterrupted sleeping means that there is no feeding or soothing. 1. Sleeping uninterrupted from midnight to 5:00 a.m. 2. Sleeping eight hours uninterrupted between sleep onset and waking time in the morning, without regard to the clock time when the sleep occurred 3. Sleeping uninterrupted between 10:00 p.m., or earlier, and 6:00 a.m.



> So by any definition, more than half of all babies are sleeping through the night by age 5 months.



> Some parents make the mistake of always putting their baby down to sleep at exactly the same time every night. For a few months this may work well, but when naps are irregular or your child stops taking the third nap, parents should learn to be more flexible in the timing of soothing to sleep at night, especially in the direction toward an earlier bedtime!



> At some future point you will teach your child other health habits such as hand washing and tooth brushing. Later still, you’re not going to risk brain damage by letting him ride his bike without a helmet. In each of these cases, you won’t let protest crying discourage you from implementing healthy practices and safety rules. Starting early and being consistent are the keys to establishing good habits.



> if you are sleeping with your baby (see co-sleeping and SIDS warning, Chapter 1) and breast-feeding, you might promptly nurse at all of these arousals while you and the baby are still in a somewhat deeper sleep state, and then there is no real sleep fragmentation. No night-waking habit might develop.



> As mentioned, a second waking for feeding may occur around 4:00 or 5:00 a.m. Some children do not get up at this time, but those children who do awaken are wet, soiled, hungry, or thirsty, and a prompt response is appropriate. While you attend to your baby’s needs, maintain silence and darkness so your child will return to sleep.



> The general guideline after 4 months of age is to feed your baby overnight when hungry, but no more than two times.



> Problems commonly occur (1) in the post-colic child who is dependent on the family bed and breast-feeding to sleep but now needs to sleep much earlier at night than the parents, (2) when parents use day care with a long commute time to bring the child home, causing a late bedtime, or (3) when dual-career families (see Chapter 11) have long commute times from work.



> One child I cared for took two to two and a half hours of soothing, rocking, or holding before she would go to sleep, and then would usually awaken three to four times each night, sometimes as often as ten times.



> One consequence of increased arousal at bedtime is that disturbed sleep produces more wakeful, irritable, and active behaviors during the day.



> But chronically fatigued babies who are overly aroused move around more in a restless, squirmy, crawly fashion when sleeping. It seems that their motor is always running at a higher speed, awake or asleep.



> What is disturbed sleep? Abnormal sleep schedules (going to bed too late, sleeping in too late in the morning, napping at the wrong times) Brief sleep durations (not enough sleep overall) Sleep fragmentation (waking up too often) Nap deprivation (no naps or brief naps) Prolonged latency to sleep (taking a long time to fall asleep) Too active sleep (lots of tossing and turning) Difficulty breathing during sleep



> Night waking may be caused by: Fever Painful ear infections Atopic dermatitis (eczema;



> If you think your child is ill, call the doctor. If your child has a diaper rash or eczema that is moderate or severe, consider using thick layers of zinc oxide paste in the diaper region so that no rash will develop when you do not go to your baby at night to change diapers.



> Many times, physical and mental activity increases around 9 months. Your child is now moving around more, exploring more, becoming more active and independent. Also, there may have been a third nap that disappeared around 9 months, and afterward your child began to slowly acquire a sleep debt.



> Most families find that if they gradually shift the bedtime earlier in twenty-minute increments, they reach a time when night wakings melt away.



> Maybe your baby sleeps well in your home but does not sleep well at Grandma’s. Try to play the same music only at sleep times at both homes. Buy something soft and safe for your baby to feel or clutch, and use it only at sleep times at both homes. Spray some fragrance or perfume around the crib or bed only at sleep times at both homes. Try to use the same sleep schedules and nap time and bedtime routines at both homes.



> Some families have their baby sleep at night in their bedroom, then use a sofa bed to convert their living room into the parents’ bedroom at night.



> Be consistent and patient. Anytime you make a change, allow at least four to five days before making another change, in order to see whether you have helped your child.



> Stated another way, children with long naps at 6 months of age continue to take long naps until 21–24 months,



> By 9 months of age, the vast majority (91 percent) of children are taking two naps.



> Willfulness (self-agency) might lead your child to protest naps because he would rather play than sleep. If you often allow him to skip his nap, then he will become fatigued. The natural adaptive response to fatigue is to fight it with stimulating hormones, which allow him to maintain more wakefulness.



> only does a vicious circle of sleep problems begin, but your child may also develop emotional ups and downs or a reduced attention span as a by-product.



> When you reestablish healthy, regular nap routines, the witching hour, bedtime battles, and night awakenings disappear. I have seen this over and over again. That’s why I think nap deprivation and not a particular “stage” is the culprit behind disturbed night sleep.



> The treatment strategy to go back to two naps involves (1) shortening the interval of wakefulness before the first nap and reestablishing the midday nap by making sure the wakeful period after the midmorning nap is not too long, (2) making sure the midday nap does not start too late in the afternoon, in order to protect a reasonable evening bedtime, and (3) consistency in the nap time ritual.



> The major fear that inhibits parents from establishing an earlier bedtime is that this will cause their child to get up earlier to start the day. In fact, the opposite will occur. An earlier bedtime will allow your child to sleep later, just as a too-late bedtime will eventually cause a too-early wake-up time. Remember, sleep begets sleep. This is not logical, but it is biological.



> As discussed previously, the five elements of healthy sleep are (1) sleep duration (night and day), (2) naps, (3) sleep consolidation, (4) sleep schedule, and (5) sleep regularity.



> In general, it is not a good idea to go to your child to start the day before 6:00 a.m., even if he is crying, because if you do, he will begin to force himself to wake up earlier and earlier in order to enjoy your company.



> This midmorning nap develops first, usually between 12 and 16 weeks of age, counting from the due date. It occurs about 9:00 a.m. and may last an hour or two.



> This violation of the rule “Never wake a sleeping baby” is to help maintain an age-appropriate sleep schedule for the benefit of the baby.



> Sleep periods shorter than thirty minutes should not count as good-quality naps.



> Alternatively, you might want to try to lengthen the nap by rushing to your child at the first sound of awakening from a brief nap (less than an hour) and attempting to soothe her back to sleep for a continuation of the nap.



> Plan for a much longer and relaxing soothing-to-sleep routine before her midmorning nap, because she will be a little overtired. Consider including a bath for relaxation, not for hygiene. Bathing might be stimulating, but more often it is calm fun for babies.



> Now, at age 11 months, he sleeps from 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. and naps twice for an hour or two. Everyone who meets him says he is happy, joyful, and alert.



> would, however, like to point out that some babies scream their brains out for two minutes, moan and whimper for three minutes, and then go to sleep for a great nap!



> Usually if a nap doesn’t occur, it is best to keep your baby awake and go to the next sleep period, whether it is another nap or nighttime sleep. Probably this next sleep period will take place a little earlier because of the missed nap.



> The second nap usually occurs between noon and 2:00 p.m., most commonly around 1:00 p.m., but in any case it should usually begin before 3:00 p.m. in order to not interfere with an early bedtime. The nap should last about an hour or two.



> The midday nap commonly continues until the third birthday, but after age 3 it begins to drop out.



> Therefore, after 6 months of age, more than 84 percent of children have no third nap, and their longest wakeful period occurs in the afternoon.



> The presence of a third nap after 6 to 9 months is often associated with a bedtime that is too late, which in turn causes issues with the two major naps and may contribute to the bedtime battles that eventually emerge around 9 to 12 months of age, when there is increasing self-agency. If so, eliminate the third nap in order to accomplish an earlier bedtime.



> The parents think the child is taking a third nap at 4:30 to 5:30 p.m. But in reality the child needs a very early bedtime, maybe around 6:00 p.m., and no playing between 7:30 and 10:00 p.m.



> If you have an intercom or baby monitor that allows you to hear all the quiet cries or sounds that occur during the arousals, turn it off. All you are accomplishing by listening to your child’s awakenings is messing up your own sleep. A mother’s sleeping brain is so sensitive to her baby’s crying that any loud, urgent call will awaken her.



> Self-agency, described above, also develops around 6 months of age and may lead to major bedtime battles or signaling at night if your child is short on sleep.



> COMMON DAY-SLEEP ISSUES IN MONTH 9 Needs Two Naps but Can Get Only One



> Another common cause of no napping occurs when the child drops the midmorning nap but the parents do not make the bedtime a little earlier.



> As mentioned above, the major sleep change that occurs before or around 9 months is the disappearance of the third nap. If the late afternoon nap persists, it often causes the bedtime to become too late. Also, children do not need to be fed at night after 9 months; children who are bottle-fed during the night are likely to develop a night-waking or night-feeding habit.



> When your child drifts toward a single nap, which is always the midday nap, often the bedtime has to be twenty or thirty minutes earlier because children in this age range tend to get more tired near the end of the day.



> Timing is important, but watch your baby more than the clock.



> The midday nap commonly continues for about 3 to 4 years.



> if you are sleeping with your baby and breast-feeding, you might promptly nurse at all of these arousals while your baby is still in a somewhat deep sleep state, and then no night-waking habit might develop.



> There are three dramatic turning points in sleep maturation for young children: 1. At 6 weeks of age, night sleep becomes organized. 2. At 4 months of age, day sleep is developing and night sleep is becoming adultlike in terms of sleep cycles. 3. At 9 months of age, the third nap is eliminated, naps may be longer for post-colic babies, and there is no need to feed babies at night.



> It cannot be emphasized enough that the major sleep problems in babies from 4 to 12 months old develop and persist because parents • Reinforce bad sleep habits by unnecessarily feeding or attending to their baby at night • Interfere with an important learning process in their child, namely, learning how to soothe themselves to sleep unassisted • Do not respect the child’s biologic nap and bedtime rhythms The



> my experience, all children who are napping well and have early bedtimes are sleeping uninterrupted through the night by 9 months or earlier.



> When the bedtime is always too late, then you should expect behavioral, emotional, and academic problems, even if your child gets up a little later or takes longer naps. When your child sleeps at night is as important as how long your child sleeps, and longer naps are not a substitute for less night sleep



> Returning to sleep unassisted is a learned skill; you should expect problems to persist in your child until she learns how to soothe herself back to sleep without your help.



> The reason is that fragmented night sleep causes daytime drowsiness and inattentiveness and, maybe, impulsiveness that can lead to injury



> Allow several days or a couple of weeks to pass before making changes. The more rested the baby becomes, the more flexible and adaptable he will be. Changes then will be less disruptive.



> But when there is some cooperation, make sure to praise the specific behavior: “Thank you for staying in bed” or “Thank you for trying to sleep.” Praising your child



> My experience this past year can be described as follows: 0–3 months is unnerving and exhausting, especially for the first-time parent; 3–6 months is anxious, wondering if you are doing the right thing; 6–9 months is more rewarding as you start to see your efforts really paying off; 9–12 months brings a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment; and 12 months and over makes all the training worth it.



> Don’t confuse these issues: • Needs versus wants • A sad cry versus a protest cry • Being abandoned versus being alone



> Night-lights might help, but a closet light or even a conventional night-light might keep a sensitive baby from sleeping well.



> what these children like to do best is to come visit with their parents and get into their bed. This not only disrupts their parents’ sleep but also harms the child.



> There is no special age when you should make this change. As long as the crib is large enough, you should not feel that your child must be placed in a regular bed by a certain age. Many parents make the switch around the second or third birthday. Let your child ask for a big bed.



> When your newborn is 4 months old and her sleep pattern is stable, events in the house are much more predictable. Your older child now becomes adjusted to the new family arrangements. Your baby goes to the crib and the older child graduates with pride to the big bed for big kids.



> Moving to a big bed too early—for example, in anticipation of the birth of a new baby—often invites a problem: the commotion and excitement surrounding the arrival of your new baby may create confusion or insecurity in your older child, who may call out or cry at night.



> If the move to a regular bed prompts frequent nocturnal visits, curtain calls, calls for help going to the bathroom, or calls for a drink of water, think before you act. A habit may slowly develop in which your child learns to expect you to spend more time with her, putting her to sleep or returning her to sleep.



> Between 2 and 6 years, the most common duration of day sleep is about two hours for those children still taking naps.



> think it is likely that most of the children who sleep near the minimum number of hours for naps have problems with night sleep, naps, or both.



> Long naps are not a substitute for a bedtime that is too late



> But Dr. Kim found that “increased weekend catch-up sleep as an indicator of insufficient weekday sleep…is associated with poor performance on objective attention tasks.” So weekend catch-up sleep does not substitute for or fully compensate for late weekday bedtimes.



> the majority of children switch to a single nap between 15 and 21 months of age; Dr. Iglowstein observed the transition age to be 18 months.



> The developing famine in sleep may be a direct contributor to the spreading epidemic of obesity and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.



> So sleeping later in the morning, taking more naps or longer naps, or trying to catch up on sleep on the weekend does not fully compensate for the harm done by a bedtime that is too late.



> In general, be cautious regarding preschool classes during the flu season. Have fun with your child, but occasionally take what my wife called a “declared holiday.” Missing a swim class, gym class, or any other preschool event now and then because your child is tired and needs to nap, or leaving a class soon after you arrive because some other children look sick, will not jeopardize your child’s college plans! Be



> Another common cause of cumulative sleepiness occurs when the child drops the midmorning nap but the parents do not make the bedtime a little earlier.



> If your child is very tired, however, she might be crashing at irregular times when she is totally exhausted. A common problem here is a bedtime that is slightly too late. Early bedtimes appear to regularize and lengthen naps.



> Another possible problem is that the bedtime is too late and the long naps are attempts to compensate for the lost sleep. In the long run, this compensation will fail because the too-late bedtime causes cumulative sleep deficits. Or maybe your child needs long naps; long sleep durations are associated with higher intelligence levels, so protect his long naps!



> The midmorning nap is always the first nap to naturally disappear. If the bedtime is moved a little earlier, most parents will notice that their child’s midmorning nap becomes briefer or turns into a quiet playtime without sleep.



> Instead of, or in addition to, an earlier bedtime, you might want to shorten the midmorning nap by waking your child after about one or one and a half hours so she will be more tired around the midday nap time.



> At 18 months, 77 percent of children take a single midday nap; by 21 months, 88 percent of children sleep only in the midday.



> You try an early bedtime, and all you get is an earlier wake-up time, which makes your child more tired in the morning and makes him need the midmorning nap all the more



> Months 21 to 36 The midday nap usually lasts until about 3 years of age and then gradually disappears. If the midday nap disappears too soon, your child may become overtired in the late afternoon and have difficulty falling asleep at night.



> SINGLE MIDDAY NAP BEGINS TO DISAPPEAR The majority (80 percent) of children between the ages of 2 and 3 years have a nap length in a narrower band between one and a half to two and a half hours. The most common nap duration between the ages of 2 and 6 years is two hours.



> Q: When do I transition my child from a crib to a bed? A: As he approaches his third birthday, let your child ask for a big bed. If you move him too soon, he may not stay in his bed because he is curious and wants to see what’s going on elsewhere in the house.



> Choose those items that work best for your child and do them at all sleep times. Slowdown activity Close physical contact Gentle massage or mild stretching Cuddle up with the child in a chair Nestle or snuggle in her bed Quiet voices Share a fun event Tell a story, talk about your family Read a book Sing or hum a song Chat about the day Say good night to everyone and everything in the room Play a favorite tape, maybe grandparents singing or saying good night, sounds of nature Comfortable room Photos of family and pets Favorite stuffed animals or dolls Night-light or flashlight Dream catcher or guardian angel for protection



> In a study of 1,105 Japanese 3-year-olds, it was observed that half fell asleep at 10:00 p.m. or later. For all children, the later they went to sleep, the later they woke up in the morning and the longer they napped. However, the later bedtime was associated with less total sleep compared to those with an earlier bedtime.



> NIGHT SLEEP Three-year-olds may no longer have tantrum behaviors, but they may call parents back many times and clearly express their feelings of love for their parents or fears of the dark.



> Not surprisingly, the two factors that most likely predicted success were both parental: the absence of marital discord and the attendance of both parents at the consultation sessions.



> It appears that sharing your plans with your older child is more likely to lead to cooperation. In office consultations, it often seems that the child is listening to the treatment plan discussed, because parents often report back that their child slept better that very night!



> Q: How important are regular bedtimes? A: In general, the bedtime should reflect your child’s needs. With decreasing naps and increasing physical activity, your child’s night-sleep needs may increase.



> The researchers noted that the more variable bedtime, as well as the lateness of bedtime, predicted poor adjustment in preschool, even after considering the roles of family stress and family management/discipline practices.



> Regularizing the sleep/wake schedule has also been shown to reduce daytime sleepiness and promote long-lasting improvements in alertness.



> Then she told our son to pretend that he was a dolphin at night and that it was perfectly all right to come up from sleep, but that he had to go back by himself. It worked.



> Most children between 3 and 6 years of age, according to my survey, still go to sleep between 7:00 and 9:00 p.m. and awaken between 6:30 and 8:00 a.m.



> Going to bed too late may cause bedtime battles, night waking, or early morning wake-ups, or it may mess up the nap schedule.



> Easier children were more regular, approaching, adaptable, mild, and positive in mood than the more difficult children. Which came first, the temperament traits or the sleep?



> I don’t think sleep habits, temperament, and fussing or crying are independent; rather, I believe they are all interrelated.



> Remember, temperament traits are not like fingerprints, which are completely biologically based, unchanging over time, or unique identifiers. Temperament traits are more like hair. Our hair has a biological basis, but it changes over time; texture, length, curliness, and color can change naturally or at our will.



> Between 4 months and 3 years, there was no individual stability regarding the durations of total sleep, night sleep, or naps, which means this time is the window of opportunity for parents to teach healthy sleep habits.



> My impression is that parents who are somewhat regular, consistent, and structured—in terms of both meeting the child’s need to sleep and helping the child learn social rules—enable the child to have fewer behavior problems.



> think the ability to return to sleep unassisted to avoid fragmented sleep (and to avoid upsetting parents!) is learned behavior. So consolidated sleep doesn’t just mean longer sleep: it helps to avoid behavior problems.



> It may seem that there is no solution to this problem, but in fact it’s not that the solution isn’t apparent. The problem is that the solution is not easy. But many worthwhile things are not easy. And as parents, we often have to place the welfare of our children above our own desires and comfort. This is such a time. An earlier bedtime, even at the cost of less family time at night, is the solution.



> However, the relationship is probably not unidirectional: child self-regulation abilities and media habits likely influence each other through a transactional process whereby parents might try to soothe fussier infants through screen time, which reduces the amount of enriching parent-infant interactions and other developmental activities, exposes infants to potentially inappropriate content, and contributes to continued regulatory difficulties, which in turn predict greater media exposure, and so on. Wake-up



> In two separate studies of experimental sleep restriction in children 10 to 14 years of age, the researchers limited night sleep either to seven hours for three days or to five hours for a single night. Although rote memory task performance and routine performance were maintained, higher cognitive functions such as verbal creativity and abstract thinking were impaired.



> Eventually your child might consider herself to be a night person, an owl. This tendency of your teenager to delay going to sleep may be normal, and so, too, may be her need to wake up later. If this is the case, then the late bedtime is not the problem; rather, it’s the too-early start of the school day that’s causing problems.



> My impression is that when teenagers are almost exhausted after school or around dinnertime, it is better not to nap then; instead, they should eat, do a little homework, go to bed early, and wake up much earlier to complete the unfinished homework.



> “Children who maintain recommended levels of sleep across the [entire] week have the most healthy and consistent levels of physical activity.…The findings suggest that it is not enough to have ‘catch-up’ sleep over the weekend, sleep regularity matters for maintaining healthy levels of activity.…



> Social jet lag may also occur in some very young children attending day care who might alternate between different sleep schedules on weekdays and weekends.



> But the greater the weekend catch-up sleep, the greater the number of errors of omission and commission observed on attention tasks. “Increased weekend catch-up sleep as an indicator of insufficient weekday sleep is associated with poor performance on objective attention tasks,”



> Her research showed that the more irregular the bedtime hour, the more impairment of grades, the more injuries associated with alcohol or drugs, and the more days missed from school.



> Our focus has always been to “work backward” from the time we wanted the children to be in bed—with enough downtime to allow for reading. That means planning dinner, homework, projects, and outdoor time to be finished early enough so that the bedtime isn’t compromised.



> Enabling our children to get more sleep is the treatment. I have observed that night terrors disappear when the parents moved the bedtime earlier by only thirty minutes.



> About 5 to 10 percent of children will bang or roll their heads from side to side before falling asleep during their first few years. This usually starts at about 8 months of age. Boys behave this way more than girls.



> Children with documented obstruction of breathing generally sleep less than normal children. At about age 4, the average duration of night sleep was only eight and a half hours in affected children, compared to ten and a quarter hours in healthy children.



> Bed-wetting during sleep normally occurs in about 20 percent of children at age 4 and 10 percent at age 5. After age 5 or 6, bed-wetting during sleep might need to be treated.



> If you are expecting another child, it is best to maintain as much regularity as possible during the pregnancy and not move your young child to a bed until the new baby is about 4 months old, if then.



> When the newborn is about 4 months old, the developing biological rhythms in your baby permit a new and stable social rhythm in the household. Your older child now knows that there are approximate times when his mother is feeding the baby or putting it to sleep.



> Now your goal is to put them down for naps at about 9:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m., and not to let them sleep at other times during the day. Expect your babies at 15 to 21 months of age to need a single nap between noon and 2:00 p.m.



> Try to flow with your child: be flexible, forget schedules, try to have as much fun as possible, and don’t worry much if your kids become tired. Irregularity and spontaneity are part of what make vacations fun.



> Fever can alter sleep patterns and can cause light sleep or more frequent awakenings. So it is not surprising that a painful illness with fever, such as an ear infection, causes an increased number of night wakings.



> Let’s say that you have a home office and have hired someone to assist you with the care of your baby. Please do not expect to work, care for your baby, and breast-feed on any regular schedule. Your baby can smell you; she will know you are there!



> This study showed that during the first 2 years of life, about one-third of the difficult children had cuts deep or severe enough to require stitches, while only 5 percent of easy babies had similar cuts.



> By age 3, the briefer the sleep, the more active, excitable, impulsive, inattentive, and easily distracted the child appeared—the perfect description of an accident-prone child. Little wonder, then, that these tired children fell more often, sustaining deep cuts.



> The message is clear: if your child is often injured, it’s not necessarily because he is careless or clumsy—he may be exhausted instead.



> In my own pediatric practice, fat babies are almost always overtired babies. That’s because their mothers have incorrectly attributed their babies’ crying to hunger instead of fatigue. These mothers are always feeding their babies, then telling me that their babies can’t sleep because they’re always hungry!



> This overfeeding habit may actually begin innocently enough in some children at 3 to 4 months of age, when nutritional feedings in the middle of the night give way to recreational feedings. Later, the bottle or breast is used as a pacifier and the frequent sipping and snacking causes excessive weight gain. Please try to become sensitive to the difference between nutritive and non-nutritive feeding.



> So when your baby gets all cranked up late at night with desperate, angry, or relentless screaming when she should be asleep, and you feel like a tightly wound spring, don’t be surprised if you feel you want to “get even” or “shut her up for good.” If you and your child don’t get the sleep you need, you may have experienced these intense feelings of anger, resentment, or ill will toward your child. That doesn’t make you a bad person. The important thing is to be aware of what you are feeling and why.
