> Science is often described as an iterative and cumulative process, a puzzle solved piece by piece, with each piece contributing a few hazy pixels of a much larger picture. But the arrival of a truly powerful new theory in science often feels far from iterative. Rather than explain one observation or phenomenon in a single, pixelated step, an entire field of observations suddenly seems to crystallize into a perfect whole. The effect is almost like watching a puzzle solve itself.

## Definition of Cancer

What kind of disease

> Cancer is not one disease but many diseases. We call them all “cancer” because they share a fundamental feature: the **abnormal growth of cells**.

Leukemia

> Leukemia is cancer of the white blood cells—cancer in one of its most explosive, violent incarnations. As one nurse on the wards often liked to remind her patients, with this disease “even a paper cut is an emergency.”

Cancer is

> Cancer, we now know, is a disease caused by the uncontrolled growth of a single cell. This growth is unleashed by **mutations—changes in DNA** that specifically affect genes that incite unlimited cell growth. In a normal cell, powerful genetic circuits regulate cell division and cell death. In a cancer cell, these **circuits have been broken, unleashing a cell that cannot stop growing**.

Compromise between mutated cells and health

> The secret to battling cancer, then, is to find means to prevent these mutations from occurring in susceptible cells, or to find means to eliminate the mutated cells without compromising normal growth. The conciseness of that statement belies the enormity of the task.

Cells' drive to grow

> Looking at cancerous growths through his microscope, Virchow discovered an **uncontrolled growth of cells** — hyperplasia in its extreme form. As Virchow examined the architecture of cancers, the growth often seemed to have acquired a life of its own, as if the cells had become possessed by a new and mysterious drive to grow.

Types of cancer

> Cancer came in diverse forms — **breast, stomach, skin, and cervical cancer, leukemias and lymphomas**. But all these diseases were deeply connected at the cellular level. In every case, cells had all acquired the same characteristic: uncontrollable pathological cell division.

Expansionist

> Cancer is an expansionist disease; it invades through tissues, sets up colonies in hostile landscapes, seeking “sanctuary” in one organ and then immigrating to another. It lives desperately, inventively, fiercely, territorially, cannily, and defensively—at times, as if teaching us how to survive.

Mutation

> Every generation of cancer cells creates a small number of cells that is genetically different from its parents. When a chemotherapeutic drug or the immune system attacks cancer, mutant clones that can resist the attack grow out. The fittest cancer cell survives.

Cancer means crab

> It was in the time of Hippocrates, around 400 BC, that a word for cancer first appeared in the medical literature: karkinos, from the Greek word for “crab.” ... For some, the hardened, matted surface of the tumor was reminiscent of the tough carapace of a crab’s body. Others felt a crab moving under the flesh as the disease spread stealthily throughout the body. For yet others, the sudden stab of pain produced by the disease was like being caught in the grip of a crab’s pincers.

Oncology word

> onkos, a word used occasionally to describe tumors, from which the discipline of oncology would take its modern name. Onkos was the Greek term for a mass or a load, or more commonly a burden; cancer was imagined as a burden carried by the body.

Choromosal chaos

> Cancer was not disorganized chromosomal chaos. It was organized chromosomal chaos: specific and identical mutations existed in particular forms of cancer.


## History

Tuberculosis

> Both drain vitality; both stretch out the encounter with death; in both cases, dying, even more than death, defines the illness. But despite such parallels, tuberculosis belongs to another century. TB (or consumption) was Victorian romanticism brought to its pathological extreme—febrile, unrelenting, breathless, and obsessive.

Oldest diesease

> discovered a jawbone dating from two million years ago from a nearby site that carried the signs of a peculiar form of lymphoma found endemically in southeastern Africa (although the origin of that tumor was never confirmed pathologically). If that finding does represent an ancient mark of malignancy, then cancer, far from being a “modern” disease, is one of the oldest diseases ever seen in a human specimen—quite possibly the oldest.

Cancer has always existed

> In most ancient societies, people didn’t live long enough to get cancer. Men and women were **long consumed by tuberculosis, dropsy, cholera, smallpox, leprosy, plague, or pneumonia**. If cancer existed, it remained submerged under the sea of other illnesses... Indeed, cancer’s emergence in the world is the product of a double negative: it becomes common only when all other killers themselves have been killed... The link was correct, but the causality was not: civilization did not cause cancer, but by extending human life spans—civilization unveiled it.

Discovery of Radium and radiation linked to cancer

> It would take biologists decades to fully decipher the mechanism that lay behind these effects, but the spectrum of damaged tissues—skin, lips, blood, gums, and nails—already provided an important clue: radium was attacking DNA. DNA is an inert molecule, exquisitely resistant to most chemical reactions, for its job is to maintain the stability of genetic information.

## Process

Science, counting and measuring

> And despite its many idiosyncrasies, leukemia possessed a singularly attractive feature: it could be measured. Science begins with counting. To understand a phenomenon, a scientist must first describe it; to describe it objectively, he must first measure it. If cancer medicine was to be transformed into a rigorous science, then cancer would need to be counted somehow—measured in some reliable, reproducible way.

Improving public health with medicine and hygiene

> New drugs appeared at an astonishing rate: by 1950, more than half the medicines in common medical use had been unknown merely a decade earlier. Perhaps even more significant than these miracle drugs, shifts in public health and **hygiene also drastically altered the national physiognomy of illness**.


Discovery of failure is dealt alone

> But there is another moment of discovery—its antithesis—that is rarely recorded: the discovery of failure. It is a moment that a scientist often encounters alone. A patient’s CT scan shows a relapsed lymphoma. A cell once killed by a drug begins to grow back. A child returns to the NCI with a headache.

Organising mundane tasks

> But collecting specimens was a rather mundane task; Hodgkin’s particular genius lay in organizing them. He became a librarian as much as a pathologist; he devised his own systematics for pathology.


## Cure

Surgery or radiation

> To cure cancer (if it could be cured at all), doctors had only two strategies: excising the tumor surgically or incinerating it with radiation—a choice between the hot ray and the cold knife.

Possible cure with folic acid

> And case by case, an incredible pattern emerged: the antifolates could drive leukemia cell counts down, occasionally even resulting in their complete disappearance—at least for a while. There were other remissions as dramatic as Sandler’s.

Relapse

> But there was always the same catch. After a few months of remission, the cancer would inevitably relapse, ultimately flinging aside even the most potent of Yella’s drugs. The cells would return in the bone marrow, then burst out into the blood, and even the most active antifolates would not keep their growth down.

Stomach cancer reduced, but lung cancer increased

> With the introduction of modern refrigeration (and possibly changes in public hygiene that have diminished the rate of endemic infection), the stomach cancer epidemic seems to have abated. In contrast, lung cancer incidence in men increased dramatically in the 1950s as a result of an increase in cigarette smoking during the early twentieth century.

Vesalius vs Galen: Theory vs empirical

> The lymphatic system carried a pale, watery fluid; the blood vessels were filled, as expected, with blood. Yellow bile was in the liver. But black bile—Galen’s oozing carrier of cancer and depression—could not be found anywhere... Vesalius hedged about his discovery. Guiltily, he heaped even more praise on the long-dead Galen. But, an empiricist to the core, Vesalius left his drawings just as he saw things, leaving others to draw their own conclusions.

The pain of surgery

> As if the pain during surgery were not bad enough, the threat of infections after surgery loomed. Those who survived the terrifying crucible of the operating table often died even more miserable deaths in their own beds soon afterward.

Anaesthesia

> Anaesthesia — the dissociation of pain from surgery—allowed surgeons to perform prolonged operations, often lasting several hours. But the hurdle of postsurgical infection remained. Until the mid-nineteenth century, such infections were common and lethal, but their cause remained a mystery.

Closed wounds

> Lister began with an old clinical observation: wounds left open to the air would quickly turn gangrenous, while closed wounds would often remain clean and uninfected.

Theory of germs by Louis Pasteur

> Based on these observations, Pasteur had made a bold claim: the turbidity was caused by the growth of invisible microorganisms—bacteria—that had fallen out of the air into the broth. Lister took Pasteur’s reasoning further. An open wound—a mixture of clotted blood and denuded flesh—was, after all, a human variant of Pasteur’s meat broth, a natural petri dish for bacterial growth.

Removal of tumours

> These procedures represented pivotal advances in the treatment of cancer. By the early twentieth century, many locally restricted cancers (i.e., primary tumors without metastatic lesions) could be removed by surgery. These included uterine and ovarian cancer, breast and prostate cancer, colon cancer, and lung cancer. If these tumors were removed before they had invaded other organs, these operations produced cures in a significant fraction of patients.

Remerging of cancer at the margins

> And to Moore’s surprise, dot by dot, a pattern had emerged. The recurrences had accumulated precisely around the margins of the original surgery, as if minute remnants of cancer had been left behind by incomplete surgery and grown back.

Over-use of surgery

> By 1898, it had transformed into a profession booming with self-confidence, a discipline so swooningly self-impressed with its technical abilities that great surgeons unabashedly imagined themselves as showmen. The **operating room was called an operating theater**, and surgery was an elaborate performance often watched by a tense, hushed audience of observers from an oculus above the theater. To watch Halsted operate, one observer wrote in 1898, was to watch the “performance of an artist"

How is survival rate calculated? Longitudinal test

> To determine whether Halsted had truly cured breast cancer, one needed to track not immediate survival, or even survival over five or ten months, but survival over five or ten years... The procedure had to be put to a test by following patients longitudinally in time.

Conclusion: Not extensive surgery, but extensive cancer

> The ultimate survival from breast cancer, in short, had little to do with how extensively a surgeon operated on the breast; it depended on how extensively the cancer had spread before surgery.

Being a scientist is like being a bookkeeper with skepticism

> By now the perpetually changing landscape of breast cancer was beginning to tire him out. Trials, tables, and charts had never been his forte; he was a surgeon, not a bookkeeper. “It is especially true of mammary cancer,” he wrote, “that the surgeon interested in furnishing the best statistics may in perfectly honorable ways provide them.” That statement—almost vulgar by Halsted’s standards—exemplified his **growing skepticism** about putting his own operation to a test.

More surgery did not mean more effective

> But what Halsted could not prove, despite his most strenuous efforts, was far more revealing. After nearly two decades of data gathering, having been levitated, praised, analyzed, and reanalyzed in conference after conference, the superiority of radical surgery in “curing” cancer still stood on shaky ground. **More surgery had just not translated into more effective therapy.**

Potential dangers of indiscriminate irradiation

> But like surgery, radiation medicine also struggled against its inherent limits. Emil Grubbe had already encountered the first of these limits with his earliest experimental treatments: since X-rays could only be directed locally, radiation was of limited use for cancers that had metasta-sized. One could double and quadruple the doses of radiant energy, but this did not translate into more cures. Instead, indiscriminate irradiation left patients scarred, blinded, and scalded by doses that had far exceeded tolerability. The second limit was far more insidious: radiation produced cancers.

Toxins, dyes and antitoxins

> The biological universe was full of molecules picking out their partners like clever locks designed to fit a key: toxins clinging inseparably to antitoxins, dyes that highlighted only particular parts of cells, chemical stains that could nimbly pick out one class of germs from a mixture of microbes.

Chemotherapy: poison or drug

> Every drug, the sixteenth-century physician Paracelsus once opined, is a poison in disguise. Cancer chemotherapy, consumed by its fiery obsession to obliterate the cancer cell, found its roots in the obverse logic: every poison might be a drug in disguise.

Randomising trials

> Hill’s proposed solution was to remove such biases by randomly assigning patients to treatment with streptomycin versus a placebo. By “randomizing” patients to each arm, any doctors’ biases in patient assignment would be dispelled. Neutrality would be enforced—and thus a hypothesis could be strictly tested. Hill’s randomized trial was a success.

When there is no treatments

> **Thrown into the uncertain front lines of cancer medicine**, juggling the most toxic and futuristic combinations of drugs, the NCI doctors fell back to their oldest principles. **They provided comfort.** They nurtured. They focused on caregiving and support. They fluffed pillows.

Challenges in molecular targets

> To design an ideal anticancer drug, one would need to identify a specific molecular target in a cancer cell and create a chemical to attack that target. But the fundamental biology of cancer was so poorly understood that defining such molecular targets was virtually inconceivable in the 1960s.

Effects of applying first treatment

> Frei and Freireich’s VAMP regimen had trailed off at a strange and bleak point. Combination chemo had cured most of the children of leukemia in their blood and bone marrow, but the **cancer had explosively relapsed in the brain**.

What cancer treatment looks like

> Test came after test. Seven months into her course, Carla had now visited the clinic sixty-six times, had had fifty-eight blood tests, seven spinal taps, and several bone marrow biopsies.

Treatments that doesn't really cure, but prolongs the life

> Kenneth Endicott, the NCI director, acknowledged in 1963. “We have certainly not found a cure for cancer. We have a dozen chemicals which are somewhat better than those known before the program began but none are dramatically better. They prolong the patient’s life somewhat and make him more comfortable, but that is all.”

How global pandemics affect

> When a disease insinuates itself so potently into the imagination of an era, it is often because it impinges on an anxiety latent within that imagination. AIDS loomed so large on the 1980s in part because this was a generation inherently haunted by its sexuality and freedom; SARS set off a panic about global spread and contagion at a time when globalism and social contagion were issues simmering nervously in the West.

Why technological projects are different from medical projects

> The Apollo mission and the Manhattan Project, the two models driving this War on Cancer were both technological achievements that stood on the shoulders of long and deep scientific discoveries (atomic physics, fluid mechanics, and thermodynamics). In contrast, even a cursory understanding of the process that made cells become malignant was missing.

Comparison on cancer fight with moon landing

> argued, “An all-out effort at this time would be like trying to land a man on the moon without knowing Newton’s laws of gravity.” James Watson, who had discovered the structure of DNA, unloosed a verbal rampage against the Senate bill. “Doing ‘relevant’ research is not necessarily doing ‘good’ research,” Watson would later write.

War analogy on cancer is also wrong!

> Scientists, too, withdrew from the war—in part, because they had little to contribute to it. The rhetoric of this war implied that **its tools, its weapons, its army, its target, and its strategy had already been assembled**. Science, the discovery of the unknown, was pushed to the peripheries of this battle.

Why aggressive surgery is not required

> If the tumor was locally confined to start with, Crile argued, then it would be adequately removed by local surgery and radiation, and manically stripping away extra nodes and muscles could add no possible benefit. In contrast, if breast cancer had already spread outside the breast, then surgery would be useless anyway, and more aggressive surgery would simply be more aggressively useless.

Power

> To measure the confidence in a negative claim, Neyman and Pearson invoked a statistical concept called power. “Power” in simplistic terms, is a measure of the ability of a test or trial to reject a hypothesis. Intuitively, Neyman and Pearson reasoned that a scientist’s capacity to reject a hypothesis depends most critically on how intensively he has tested the hypothesis—and thus, on the number of samples that have independently been tested.

Recruiting for trials

> For any trial to be adequately “powered,” it needs to **recruit an adequate number of patients**. But to recruit patients, a trialist has to convince doctors to participate in the trial—and yet these doctors are often precisely those who have the least interest in having a theory rejected or disproved.

Controlled trials for radical surgery

> The only way to turn the upside-down tapestry of Halstedian theory around was to run a controlled clinical trial to test the radical mastectomy against the simple mastectomy and lumpectomy+radiation. But Fisher also knew that **resistance would be fierce to any such trial**.

Experience != Scientific validity

> “The clinician, no matter how venerable, must accept the fact that **experience, voluminous as it might be, cannot be employed as a sensitive indicator of scientific validity**,” Fisher wrote in an article. He was willing to have faith in divine wisdom, but not in Halsted as divine wisdom. “In God we trust,” he brusquely told a journalist. “**All others [must] have data**.”

How data proved that radical mastectomy is not required

> In 1981, the results of the trial were finally made public. The rates of breast cancer recurrence, relapse, death, and distant cancer metastasis were statistically identical among all three groups. The group treated with the radical mastectomy had paid heavily in morbidity, but accrued no benefits in survival, recurrence, or mortality.

Every single patient's recovery adds to saving a million more!

> At the NIH, Alsop wrote pointedly, “Saving the individual patient is not the essential mission. Enormous efforts are made to do so, or at least to prolong the patient’s life to the last possible moment. But the **basic purpose is not to save that patient’s particular life but to find means of saving the lives of others**.”

At the height of chemotherapy

> Between 1984 and 1985, at the midpoint of the most aggressive expansion of chemotherapy, nearly **six thousand articles were published on the subject in medical journals**. Not a single article reported a new strategy for the definitive cure of an advanced solid tumor by means of combination chemotherapy alone.

Healing prostrate cancer

> If he injected the castrated dogs with purified testosterone, the exogenous hormone saved the prostate from shriveling. Prostate cells were thus acutely dependent on the hormone testosterone for their growth and function. Female sexual hormones kept breast cells alive; male hormones had a similar effect on prostate cells.

Combining surgery and chemotherapy

> In his small trial, Carbone found that adding chemotherapy after surgery decreased the rate of relapse from breast cancer. To describe this form of treatment, Carbone and his team used the word adjuvant, from the Latin phrase “to help.”

Different treatment for different stages of cancer

> The meticulous separation of breast cancer into distinct stages, for instance, was a crucial prerequisite to the success of Bonadonna’s study: early-stage breast cancer could not be treated like late-stage breast cancer.

Death meant failure

> The resistance to providing palliative care to patients,” a ward nurse recalls, “was so deep that doctors would not even look us in the eye when we recommended that they stop their efforts to save lives and start saving dignity instead… doctors were allergic to the smell of death. Death meant failure, defeat—their death, the death of medicine, the death of oncology.”

Using opiates

> Opiates, used liberally and compassionately on cancer patients, did not cause addiction, deterioration, and suicide; instead, they relieved the punishing cycle of anxiety, pain, and despair. New antinausea drugs were deployed that vastly improved the lives of patients on chemotherapy.

Early detection tests

> Finally, Cairns factored in screening strategies such as Pap smears and mammograms that detected cancer in its early stages. These, he estimated loosely, saved an additional 10,000 to 15,000 cancer-related deaths per year. The grand tally, generously speaking, amounted to about 35,000 to 40,000 lives per year.

Increase in lung cancer

> Bailar and Smith found that even Cairns had been overgenerous: between 1962 and 1985, cancer-related deaths had increased by 8.7 percent. That increase reflected many factors—most potently, an increase in smoking rates in the 1950s that had resulted in an increase in lung cancer.

How to measure success rate of cancer?

> A young woman cured of lymphoma, with fifty additional years of life, was judged by the same metric as an elderly woman cured of breast cancer, who might succumb to some other cause of death in the next year. If “years of life saved” was used as a measure of progress on cancer, then the numbers turned far more palatable. Now, instead of losing the War on Cancer, it appeared that we were winning it.

Funds for prevention vs treatment

> A vast majority of the institute’s grants, 80 percent, were directed toward treatment strategies for cancer; prevention research received about 20 percent. (By 1992, this number had increased to 30 percent;

3 approaches to cancer

> Frank Rauscher, wrote effusively about its three-pronged approach to cancer: “Treatment, Rehabilitation and Continuing Care.” That there was no mention of either prevention or early detection was symptomatic: the institute did not even consider cancer prevention a core strength.

Challenge in overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis

> The trouble is that overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis are often intrinsically conjoined, locked perpetually on two ends of a seesaw. Screening tests that strive to limit overdiagnosis—by narrowing the criteria by which patients are classified as positive—often pay the price of increasing underdiagnosis because they miss patients that lie in the gray zone between positive and negative.

Being overenthusiastic is dangerous

> Like all patients, Carla smells overenthusiasm with deep suspicion: a doctor who raves disproportionately about small victories is the same doctor who might be preparing his patient for some ultimate defeat.



## Scrotal cancer

Link between scrotal cancer and soot!

> But as cases streamed into his London clinic, he noticed a larger trend. His patients were almost invariably chimney sweeps or “climbing-boys”—poor, indentured orphans apprenticed to sweeps and sent up into chimneys to clean the flues of ash, often nearly naked and swathed in oil. The correlation startled Pott.

External agents causing cancer

> The implication of Pott’s work was far-reaching. If soot, and not some mystical, numinous humor (à la Galen), caused scrotal cancer, then two facts had to be true. First, external agents, rather than imbalances of internal fluids, had to lie at the root of carcinogenesis!... Second, if a foreign substance was truly the cause, then cancer was potentially preventable.

Removal of Carcinogens

> There was no need to purge the body of fluids. Since the illness was man-made, its solution could also be man-made. Remove the carcinogen—and cancer would stop appearing.

How scrotal cancer was prevented in young boys

> By the late eighteenth century, the embarrassing plight of London’s climbing-boys was publicly exposed, and social reformers in England sought to create laws to regulate the occupation. In 1788, the Chimney Sweepers Act was passed in Parliament, preventing master sweeps from employing children under eight... Pott did not live to see the changes—he contracted pneumonia and died in 1788—but the man-made epidemic of scrotal cancer among sweeps vanished over several decades.

## Lung Cancer

How lunch cancer spread

> By 1855, English, Russian, and French soldiers were all puffing their tobacco rations rolled up in paper. When these soldiers returned from the war, they brought their habits, like viruses again, to their respective homelands with them.

How cigarettes spread

> In the turbulent century between 1850 and 1950, the world offered conflict, atomization, and disorientation. The cigarette offered its equal and opposite salve: camaraderie, a sense of belonging, and the familiarity of habits. If cancer is the quintessential product of modernity, then so, too, is its principal preventable cause: tobacco.

When something is so permissive in life, how to derive any linkages?

> By the early 1940s, asking about a connection between tobacco and cancer was like asking about an association between sitting and cancer.” If nearly all men smoked, and only some of them developed cancer, then how might one tease apart the statistical link between one and the other?

Linking lung cancer with smoking

> By May 1, 1948, 156 interviews had come in. And as Doll and Hill sifted through the preliminary batch of responses, only one solid and indisputable statistical association with lung cancer leapt out: cigarette smoking. As more interviews poured in week after week, the **statistical association strengthened**... In the middle of the survey, sufficiently alarmed, he gave up smoking.

How to collect stats about correlating deaths and cigarette

> Each time a death in the cohort was reported, they contacted the registrar’s office to determine the precise cause of death. Deaths from lung cancer were tabulated for smokers versus nonsmokers. Doll and Hill could now sit back and watch cancer unfold in real time.

Data proves lung cancer and smoking

> In the twenty-nine months between October 1951 and March 1954, 789 deaths were reported in Doll and Hill’s original cohort. Thirty-six of these were attributed to lung cancer. When these lung cancer deaths were counted in smokers versus nonsmokers, the correlation virtually sprang out: **all thirty-six of the deaths had occurred in smokers**.

Smoking and lung cancer

> Piece by piece, a highly incontrovertible and consistent picture emerged. The relationship between smoking and lung cancer, the committee found, was one of the strongest in the history of cancer epidemiology—remarkably significant, remarkably conserved between diverse populations, remarkably durable over time, and remarkably reproducible in trial after trial.

Smoking has a long afterlife of 30 years!

> Yet, old sins have long shadows, and carcinogenic sins especially so. The lag time between tobacco exposure and lung cancer is **nearly three decades**, and the lung cancer epidemic in America will have an afterlife long after smoking incidence has dropped.

## Vaginal and uterine cancer

DES as carcinogens

> DES was widely prescribed to pregnant women in the 1950s to prevent premature deliveries (although it was of only questionable benefit in this regard). A generation later, when women with vaginal and uterine cancer were questioned about their exposures to estrogens, a peculiar pattern emerged: the women had not been exposed to the chemical directly, but their mothers had been. The carcinogen had skipped a generation.

Chemicals and carcinogen link

> Ames could now test thousands of chemicals to create a catalog of chemicals that increased the mutation rate—mutagens. And as he populated his catalog, he made a seminal observation: **chemicals that scored as mutagens in his test tended to be carcinogens as well**. Dye derivatives, known to be potent human carcinogens, scored floridly, causing hundreds of colonies of bacteria. So did X-rays, benzene compounds, and nitrosoguanidine derivatives—all known to cause cancers in rats and mice. In the tradition of all good tests,** Ames’s test transformed the unobservable and immeasurable into the observable and measurable**.

Why carcinogens cause cancer?

> But despite its shortcomings, the Ames test provided an important link between a purely descriptive approach toward cancer prevention and a mechanistic approach. Carcinogens, Ames suggested, had a common, distinctive functional property: **they altered genes**.

How to identify carcinogens?

> why was the capacity to cause mutations linked to the ability to induce cancer? But he had demonstrated that carcinogens could be found experimentally—not retrospectively (by investigating cases and controls in human subjects) but **by prospectively identifying chemicals** that could cause mutations in a rather simple and elegant biological assay.

## Cervical Cancer

Reason for Pap smear

> Papanicolaou verbalized a strand of thought that he had been spinning internally for nearly a decade. The thought almost convulsed out of him. The **real use of the Pap smear was not to find cancer, but rather to detect its antecedent**, its precursor—the portent of cancer... “A Pap smear would give a woman a chance to receive preventive care [and] greatly decrease the likelihood of her ever developing cancer.” Cervical cancer typically arises in an outer layer of the cervix, then grows in a flaky, superficial whirl before burrowing inward into the surrounding tissues.

Curable cancer

> The Pap smear had, in effect, **pushed the clock of cancer detection forward** by nearly two decades, and changed the spectrum of cervical cancer from predominantly incurable to predominantly curable.



Challenges in screening tests

> We want every cancer test to **operate with perfect specificity and sensitivity**. But the technologies for screening are not perfect. Screening tests thus routinely fail because they cannot even cross this preliminary hurdle—the **rate of over- or underdiagnosis is unacceptably high**.

## Breast cancer

Mamography helps!

> In 1988, at the end of its twelfth year, the Malmö study reported its results. Overall, 588 women had been diagnosed with breast cancer in the screened group, and 447 in the control group—underscoring, once again, the capacity of mammography to detect early cancers.

AIDS and Cancer

> Like cancer patients, AIDS patients were also paralyzed and shrouded by those metaphors—stripped bare, like the cancer patient in Solzhenitsyn’s Cancer Ward, then forced to don the ghoulish uniform of their disease. The **stigmas attached to cancer—guilt, secrecy, shame**—were recycled and refitted for AIDS, acquiring tenfold force and potency: sexual guilt, sexual secrecy, sexual shame.

## Improvements

Colon cancer

> Death rates from colon cancer, for instance, had fallen by nearly 30 percent, and from cervical and uterine cancer by 20. Both diseases could be detected by screening tests (colonoscopy for colon cancer, and Pap smears for cervical cancer) and at least part of the decrease in mortality was the likely consequence of earlier detection.

Lung Cancer

> The incidence of lung cancer was highest in those above fifty-five, and was lower in men and women below fifty-five, a **consequence of changes in smoking behavior since the 1950s**. The decrease in cancer mortality in younger men and women had been perfectly offset by the increase in cancer mortality in older men and women.

## Biology and cells

Chromosomes

> But was it cause or effect? Had cancer altered the structure of chromosomes? Or had chromosomal changes precipitated cancer? Von Hansemann had observed a correlation between chromosomal change and cancer.

X-Rays causing more mutation

> Muller found that he could accelerate the incidence of these accidents. Using X-rays to bombard flies, he found that he could produce hundreds of mutant flies over a few months—more than Morgan and his colleagues had produced using their vast breeding program over nearly two decades.

Virologists, vs Epidemiologists vs Geneticians

> By the early 1950s, cancer researchers had thus split into three feuding camps. The virologists, led by Rous, claimed that viruses caused cancer, although no such virus had been found in human studies. Epidemiologists, such as Doll and Hill, argued that exogenous chemicals caused cancer, although they could not offer a mechanistic explanation for their theory or results. The third camp, of Theodor Boveri’s successors, stood at the farthest periphery. They possessed weak, circumstantial evidence that genes internal to the cell might cause cancer, but had neither the powerful human data of the epidemiologists

Why non-smokers also have lung cancer?

> The theory clarified why the same kind of cancer might arise in smokers and nonsmokers, albeit at different rates: both smokers and nonsmokers have the same proto-oncogenes in their cells, **but smokers develop cancer at a higher rate** because carcinogens in tobacco increase the mutation rate of these genes.






> Genes are units of inheritance: they shuttle properties—traits—from one generation to the next. If genes cause cancer, Knudson reasoned, then he might capture a pattern in the inheritance of cancer, much as Mendel had captured the idea of a gene by studying the inheritance of flower color or plant height in peas.



> He wondered whether he could discern a subtle difference in the development of cancer between the sporadic and the inherited versions using mathematical analyses. He performed the simplest of experiments: he grouped children with the sporadic form into one cohort and children with the familial form in a second.



> In inherited retinoblastoma, cancer onset was rapid, with diagnosis typically two to six months after birth. Sporadic retinoblastoma typically appeared two to four years after birth.



> These children are thus predisposed to the cancer, and they develop cancer faster, producing the “rapid velocity” tumors that Knudson saw in his statistical charts. Knudson called this the two-hit hypothesis of cancer. For certain cancer-causing genes, two mutational “hits” were needed to provoke cell division and thus produce cancer.



> When this unanticipated fact proves true or the event does occur, the theory gains credibility and robustness. Newton’s understanding of gravitation was most spectacularly validated when it accurately presaged the return of Halley’s comet in 1758. Einstein’s theory of relativity was vindicated in 1919 by the demonstration that light from distant stars is “bent” by the mass of the sun, just as predicted by the theory’s equations.



> By the mid-1970s, Weinberg had acquired a reputation among his colleagues as a careful, technically competent scientist, but one who lacked direction. Weinberg felt his work was stagnating. What he needed was a simple, clear question.



> Of the twenty thousand genes in a cancer cell, Weinberg reasoned the vast majority were likely normal and only a small minority were mutated proto-oncogenes. Now imagine, for a moment, being able to take all twenty thousand genes in the cancer cell, the good, the bad, the ugly, and transferring them into twenty thousand normal cells, such that each cell receives one of the genes. The normal, unmutated genes will have little effect on the cells.



> If activated oncogenes existed within cancer cells, then transferring these genes into normal cells should induce these normal cells to divide and proliferate.



> In cancer cells, the gene was mutated, just as Varmus and Bishop had predicted. Mutated ras encoded a berserk, perpetually hyperactive protein permanently locked “on.” This mutant protein produced an unquenchable signal for a cell to divide—and to keep dividing. It was the long-sought “native” human oncogene, captured in flesh and blood out of a cancer cell.



> Varmus and Bishop’s theory—that oncogenes were activated cellular genes—was recognized to be widely true for many forms of cancer. And the two-hit hypothesis—that tumor suppressors were genes that needed to be inactivated in both chromosomes—was also found to be widely applicable in cancer. A rather general conceptual framework for carcinogenesis was slowly becoming apparent.



> Koch had postulated that for an agent to be identified as the “cause” of a disease, it must (1) be present in the diseased organism, (2) be capable of being isolated from the diseased organism, and (3) re-create the disease in a secondary host when transferred from the diseased organism. Oncogenes had met the first two criteria. They had been found to be present in cancer cells and they had been isolated from cancer cells. But no one had shown that a cancer gene, in and of itself, could create a bona fide tumor in an animal.



> Cancer is not merely a lump in the body; it is a disease that migrates, evolves, invades organs, destroys tissues, and resists drugs. Activating even two potent proto-oncogenes had not recapitulated the full syndrome of cancer in every cell of the mouse.



> Decades before cervical cancer evolved into its fiercely invasive incarnation, whorls of noninvasive premalignant cells could be observed in the tissue, beginning their first steps in the grisly march toward cancer. (Identifying and eradicating this premalignant stage before the cancer spreads is the basis for the Pap smear.)



> Similarly, Auerbach had noted, premalignant cells were seen in smokers’ lungs long before lung cancer appeared. Colon cancer in humans also underwent graded and discrete changes in its progression, from a noninvasive premalignant lesion called an adenoma to the highly invasive terminal stage called an invasive carcinoma.



> Cancer cells did not activate or inactivate genes at random. Instead, the shift from a premalignant state to an invasive cancer could precisely be correlated with the activation and inactivation of genes in a strict and stereotypical sequence.



> This was a relief. In the decade between 1980 and 1990, proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes had been discovered in such astonishing numbers in the human genome—at last count, about one hundred such genes—that their abundance raised a disturbing question: if the genome was so densely littered with such intemperate genes—genes waiting to push a cell toward cancer as if at the flick of a switch—then why was the human body not exploding with cancer every minute?



> First, proto-oncogenes need to be activated through mutations, and mutations are rare events. Second, tumor suppressor genes need to be inactivated, but typically two copies exist of each tumor suppressor gene, and thus two independent mutations are needed to inactivate a tumor suppressor, an even rarer event.



> Cancer’s march was long and slow and proceeded though many mutations in many genes over many iterations. In genetic terms, our cells were not sitting on the edge of the abyss of cancer. They were dragged toward that abyss in graded, discrete steps.



> Folkman’s Harvard colleague Stan Korsmeyer found other activated pathways in cancer cells, originating in mutated genes, that also blocked cell death, thus imbuing cancer cells with the capacity to resist death signals. Other pathways allowed cancer cells to acquire motility, the capacity to move from one tissue to another—initiating metastasis. Yet other gene cascades increased cell survival in hostile environments,



> Cancer, in short, was not merely genetic in its origin; it was genetic in its entirety. Abnormal genes governed all aspects of cancer’s behavior. Cascades of aberrant signals, originating in mutant genes, fanned out within the cancer cell, promoting survival, accelerating growth, enabling mobility, recruiting blood vessels, enhancing nourishment, drawing oxygen—sustaining cancer’s life.



> The cell containing the mutant gene is driven to grow more swiftly than its neighbors and creates a clump within the original clump of cells. It is not yet a cancer cell, but a cell in which uncontrolled cell division has partly been unleashed—cancer’s primordial ancestor. A decade passes. The small collection of ras-mutant cells continues to proliferate, unnoticed, in the far periphery of the lung.



> Now a fatal march is on; an unraveling begins. The cells, now with four mutations, begin to outgrow their brethren. As the cells grow, they acquire additional mutations and they activate pathways, resulting in cells even further adapted for growth and survival.



> “We suggest that the vast catalog of cancer cell genotypes is a manifestation of six essential alterations in cell physiology that collectively dictate malignant growth.”   1. Self-sufficiency in growth signals:



> 2. Insensitivity to growth-inhibitory (antigrowth) signals:



> 3. Evasion of programmed cell death (apoptosis):



> 4. Limitless replicative potential:



> 5. Sustained angiogenesis:



> 6. Tissue invasion and metastasis:



> “Some would argue that the search for the origin and treatment of this disease will continue over the next quarter century in much the same manner as it has in the recent past, by adding further layers of complexity to a scientific literature that is already complex almost beyond measure.



> Weinberg and Hanahan posited: “With holistic clarity of mechanism, cancer prognosis and treatment will become a rational science, unrecognizable by current practitioners.”



> Cancer is not a concentration camp, but it shares the quality of annihilation: it negates the possibility of life outside and beyond itself; it subsumes all living. The daily life of a patient becomes so intensely preoccupied with his or her illness that the world fades away. Every last morsel of energy is spent tending the disease.



> When I asked a woman with a rare form of muscle sarcoma about her life outside the hospital, she told me that she spent her days and nights scouring the Internet for news about the disease. “I am in the hospital,” she said, “even when I am outside the hospital.”



> As a medical procedure, childbirth is least likely to involve infectious complications and is thus the safest neighbor to a chemotherapy ward, where any infection can turn into a lethal rampage. As in so much in medicine, the juxtaposition between the two wards is purely functional and yet just as purely profound.)



> Some days I dreaded walking by the fax machines outside my office, where a pile of death certificates would be waiting for my signature.



> He assured me that he would visit to follow up, but I wasn’t convinced. Orman epitomized the afterlife of cancer—eager to forget the clinic and its bleak rituals, like a bad trip to a foreign country.



> I have chosen these cases not because they were “miraculous” but because of precisely the opposite reason. They represent a routine spectrum of survivors—Hodgkin’s disease cured with multidrug chemotherapy; locally advanced lung cancer controlled with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation; lymphoblastic leukemia in a prolonged remission after intensive chemotherapy.



> Incremental advances can add up to transformative changes. In 2005, an avalanche of papers cascading through the scientific literature converged on a remarkably consistent message—the national physiognomy of cancer had subtly but fundamentally changed.



> The mortality for nearly every major form of cancer—lung, breast, colon, and prostate—had continuously dropped for fifteen straight years. There had been no single, drastic turn but rather a steady and powerful attrition: mortality had declined by about 1 percent every year. The rate might sound modest, but its cumulative effect was remarkable: between 1990 and 2005, the cancer-specific death rate had dropped nearly 15 percent, a decline unprecedented in the history of the disease.



> What precipitated this steady decline? There was no single answer but rather a multitude. For lung cancer, the driver of decline was primarily prevention—a



> For colon and cervical cancer, the declines were almost certainly due to the successes of secondary prevention—cancer screening.



> For leukemia, lymphoma, and testicular cancer, in contrast, the declining numbers reflected the successes of chemotherapeutic treatment.



> Perhaps most symbolically, the decline in breast cancer mortality epitomized the cumulative and collaborative nature of these victories—and the importance of attacking cancer using multiple independent prongs.



> Three interventions had potentially driven down the breast cancer death rate—mammography (screening to catch early breast cancer and thereby prevent invasive breast cancer), surgery, and adjuvant chemotherapy (chemotherapy after surgery to remove remnant cancer cells).



> But she had expected cancer medicine to have achieved more during her lifetime—to have taken a more assertive step toward Farber’s “universal cure” for cancer and marked a more definitive victory in the war. The complexity, the tenacity—the sheer magisterial force of cancer—had made even its most committed and resolute opponent seem circumspect and humbled.



> “Our knowledge of… molecular defects in cancer has come from a dedicated twenty years of the best molecular biology research. Yet this information does not translate to any effective treatments nor to any understanding of why many of the current treatments succeed or why others fail.



> To target cancer cells with novel therapies, scientists and physicians needed new vulnerabilities that were unique to cancer.



> First, cancer cells are driven to grow because of the accumulation of mutations in their DNA.



> Second, proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes typically lie at the hubs of cellular signaling pathways.



> Third, the relentless cycle of mutation, selection, and survival creates a cancer cell that has acquired several additional properties besides uncontrolled growth.



> It was one thing to identify an Achilles’ heel—and quite another to discover a weapon that would strike it. Until the late 1980s, no drug had reversed an oncogene’s activation or a tumor suppressor’s inactivation.



> By 1993, Wang and Degos concluded that 75 percent of their patients treated with the combination of trans-retinoic acid and standard chemotherapy would never relapse—a percentage unheard of in the history of APL.



> Slamon and Ullrich now had all three essential ingredients for a targeted therapy for cancer: an oncogene, a form of cancer that specifically activated that oncogene, and a drug that specifically targeted it.



> She quizzed me about my research. I thanked her for her time, but she, in turn, apologized for the distraction. “Get back to work,” she said, laughing. “There are people waiting for discoveries.”



> Breast cancer activists saw a grim reflection of their own struggle in these early battles. As one newsletter put it, “Why do women dying of breast cancer have such trouble getting experimental drugs that could extend their lives?



> Outrage, rising to a crescendo, threatened to spiral into a public relations disaster. Genentech had a narrow choice: unable to silence the activists, it was forced to join them.



> For Genentech, this was a long-overdue education. Rather than running trials on breast cancer patients, the company learned to run trials with breast cancer patients. (Genentech would eventually outsource the compassionate-access program to a lottery system run by an independent agency.



> Women applied to the lottery and “won” the right to be treated, thus removing the company from any ethically difficult decision-making.)



> [It was] what a locksmith does when he has to make a key fit,” Zimmermann said. “You change the shape of the key and test it. Does it fit? If not, you change it again.” By the early nineties, this fitting and refitting had created dozens of new molecules that were structurally related to Matter’s original kinase inhibitor.



> He drew out samples of bone marrow from a few human patients with CML and applied CGP57148 to the cells in a petri dish. The leukemia cells in the marrow died immediately. The only cells remaining in the dish were normal blood cells. He had cured leukemia in the dish.



> For Novartis, it was the exquisite specificity of CGP57148 that was precisely its fatal undoing. Developing CGP57148 into a clinical drug for human use would involve further testing—animal studies and clinical trials that would cost $100 to $200 million. CML afflicts a few thousand patients every year in America. The prospect of spending millions on a molecule to benefit thousands gave Novartis cold feet.



> Left untreated, chronic myeloid leukemia is only “chronic” by the standards of leukemia: as the disease accelerates, the symptoms run on a tighter, faster arc and most patients live only three to five years. Patients on Gleevec experienced a palpable deceleration of their disease. The balance between normal and malignant cells was restored. It was an unsuppuration of blood.



> Today when I see a patient with CML, I tell them that the disease is an indolent leukemia with an excellent prognosis, that they will usually live their functional life span provided they take an oral medicine, Gleevec, for the rest of their lives.”



> For generations, four minutes was thought to represent an intrinsic physiological limit, as if muscles could inherently not be made to move any faster or lungs breathe any deeper. What Bannister proved was that such notions about intrinsic boundaries are mythical. What he broke permanently was not a limit, but the idea of limits.



> Based on that survival figure, Hagop Kantarjian estimates that within the next decade, 250,000 people will be living with CML in America, all of them on targeted therapy. Druker’s drug will alter the national physiognomy of cancer, converting a once-rare disease into a relatively common one. (Druker jokes that



> Given that most of our social networks typically extend to about one thousand individuals, each of us, on average, will know one person with this leukemia who is being kept alive by a targeted anticancer drug.



> Even targeted therapy, then, was a cat-and-mouse game. One could direct endless arrows at the Achilles’ heel of cancer, but the disease might simply shift its foot, switching one vulnerability for another. We were locked in a perpetual battle with a volatile combatant.



> Treatment of multiple myeloma today involves mixing and matching these drugs with standard chemotherapies, switching drugs when the tumor relapses, and switching again when the tumor relapses again. No single drug or treatment cures myeloma outright; myeloma is still a fatal disease.



> But recently, a conceptual transformation in epidemiological thinking has also been spearheaded here. Epidemiologists typically measure the risk factors for chronic, noninfectious illnesses by studying the behavior of individuals. But recently, they have asked a very different question: what if the real locus of risk lies not in the behaviors of individual actors, but in social networks?



> When the epidemiologists juxtaposed smoking behavior onto this network and followed the pattern of smoking over decades, a notable phenomenon emerged: circles of relationships were found to be more powerful predictors of the dynamics of smoking than nearly any other factor. Entire networks stopped smoking concordantly, like whole circuits flickering off.



> When highly connected “socializers” stopped smoking, the dense social circle circumscribed around them also slowly stopped as a group. As a result, smoking gradually became locked into the far peripheries of all networks, confined to the “loners” with few social contacts, puffing away quietly in the distant and isolated corners of the town.



> When antitobacco campaigns lose their effectiveness or penetrance—as has recently happened among teens in America or in Asia—smoking often returns like an old plague. Social behavior metastasizes, eddying out from its center toward the peripheries of social networks. Mini-epidemics of smoking-related cancers are sure to follow.



> Our bodies, our cells, our genes are thus being immersed and reimmersed in a changing flux of molecules—pesticides, pharmaceutical drugs, plastics, cosmetics, estrogens, food products, hormones, even novel forms of physical impulses, such as radiation and magnetism. Some of these, inevitably, will be carcinogenic. We cannot wish this world away; our task, then, is to sift through it vigilantly to discriminate bona fide carcinogens from innocent and useful bystanders.



> But when researchers evaluated the data meticulously, a puzzling pattern emerged: right-sided cell phone use reduced the risk of left-sided brain cancer. The simplest logical explanation for this phenomenon was “recall bias”: patients diagnosed with tumors unconsciously exaggerated the use of cell phones on the same side of their head, and selectively forgot the use on the other side.



> The cell phone case is a sobering reminder of the methodological rigor needed to evaluate new carcinogens. It is easy to fan anxiety about cancer. Identifying a true preventable carcinogen, estimating the magnitude of risk at reasonable doses and at reasonable exposures, and reducing exposure through scientific and legislative intervention—keeping the legacy of Percivall Pott alive—is far more complex.



> It poses not one but two challenges. The first, the “biological challenge” of cancer, involves “harnessing the fantastic rise in scientific knowledge… to conquer this ancient and terrible illness.” But the second, the “social challenge,” is just as acute: it involves forcing ourselves to confront our customs, rituals, and behaviors.



> These, unfortunately, are not customs or behaviors that lie at the peripheries of our society or selves, but ones that lie at their definitional cores: what we eat and drink, what we produce and exude into our environments, when we choose to reproduce, and how we age.



> it was with my visit. Its purpose was to declare her illness over, to normalize her life—to sever the force that had locked us together for five years.



> The Human Genome Project, the full sequence of the normal human genome, was completed in 2003. In its wake comes a far less publicized but vastly more complex project: fully sequencing the genomes of several human cancer cells. Once completed, this effort, called the Cancer Genome Atlas, will dwarf the Human Genome Project in its scope.



> As of 2009, the genomes of ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, melanoma, lung cancer, and several forms of leukemia have been sequenced, revealing the full catalog of mutations in each tumor type.



> Against the background of this negative space, Vogelstein placed mutations. Every time a gene mutation was encountered in a cancer, the mutated gene was demarcated as a dot on the sheet. As the frequency of mutations in any given gene increased, the dots grew in height into ridges and hills and then mountains. The most commonly mutated genes in breast cancer samples were thus represented by towering peaks, while genes rarely mutated were denoted by small hills or flat dots.



> Viewed thus, the cancer genome is at first glance a depressing place. Mutations litter the chromosomes. In individual specimens of breast and colon cancer, between fifty to eighty genes are mutated; in pancreatic cancers, about fifty to sixty.



> Every patient’s cancer is unique because every cancer genome is unique. Physiological heterogeneity is genetic heterogeneity.” Normal cells are identically normal; malignant cells become unhappily malignant in unique ways.



> Other mutations are not passive players. Unlike the passenger mutations, these altered genes directly goad the growth and the biological behavior of cancer cells. These are “driver” mutations, mutations that play a crucial role in the biology of a cancer cell.



> In the breast cancer sample from the forty-three-year-old woman with 127 mutations, only about ten might directly be contributing to the actual growth and survival of her tumor, while the rest may have been acquired due to gene-copying errors in cancer cells. But while functionally different, these two forms of mutations cannot easily be distinguished.



> The bedlam of the cancer genome, in short, is deceptive. If one listens closely, there are organizational principles. The language of cancer is grammatical, methodical, and even—I hesitate to write—quite beautiful. Genes talk to genes and pathways to pathways in perfect pitch, producing a familiar yet foreign music that rolls faster and faster into a lethal rhythm.



> Gene by gene, and now pathway by pathway, we have an extraordinary glimpse into the biology of cancer. The complete maps of mutations in many tumor types (with their hills, valleys, and mountains) will soon be complete, and the core pathways that are mutated fully defined.



> This seminal transition from descriptive biology to the functional biology of cancer will provoke three new directions for cancer medicine. The first is a direction for cancer therapeutics.



> Testifying before Congress in 1969, Watson had lambasted the War on Cancer as ludicrously premature. Forty years later, he was far less critical: “We shall soon know all the genetic changes that underlie the major cancers that plague us. We already know most, if not all, of the major pathways through which cancer-inducing signals move through cells.



> The second new direction is for cancer prevention. To date, cancer prevention has relied on two disparate and polarized methodologies to try to identify preventable carcinogens. There



> But important preventable carcinogens might escape detection by either strategy. Subtle risk factors for cancer require enormous population studies; the subtler the effect, the larger the population needed. Such vast, unwieldy, and methodologically challenging studies are difficult to fund and launch.



> A chemical may not cause overt cancer in animal studies, but may be shown to activate cancer-linked genes and pathways, thus shifting the burden of proof of its potential carcinogenicity.



> An emerging, although highly controversial, answer to this question is that cancer’s immortality, too, is borrowed from normal physiology. The human embryo and many of our adult organs possess a tiny population of stem cells that are capable of immortal regeneration.



> Under normal conditions, only a fraction of these blood-forming stem cells are active; the rest are deeply quiescent—asleep. But if blood is suddenly depleted, by injury or chemotherapy, say, then the stem cells awaken and begin to divide with awe-inspiring fecundity, generating cells that generate thousands upon thousands of blood cells.



> Indeed, cancer stem cells have acquired the behavior of normal stem cells by activating the same genes and pathways that make normal stem cells immortal—except, unlike normal stem cells, they cannot be lulled back into physiological sleep. Cancer, then, is quite literally trying to emulate a regenerating organ—or perhaps, more disturbingly, the regenerating organism.



> Its quest for immortality mirrors our own quest, a quest buried in our embryos and in the renewal of our organs. Someday, if a cancer succeeds, it will produce a far more perfect being than its host—imbued with both immortality and the drive to proliferate.



> One might argue that the leukemia cells growing in my laboratory derived from the woman who died three decades earlier have already achieved this form of “perfection.”



> The question then will not be if we will encounter this immortal illness in our lives, but when.



> Medicine, then, is fundamentally a technological art; at its core lies a desire to improve human lives by intervening on life itself. Conceptually, the battle against cancer pushes the idea of technology to its far edge, for the object being intervened upon is our genome.



> Perhaps cancer defines the inherent outer limit of our survival. As our cells divide and our bodies age, and as mutations accumulate inexorably upon mutations, cancer might well be the final terminus in our development as organisms.



> As Doll suggests, and as Atossa epitomizes, we might as well focus on prolonging life rather than eliminating death. This War on Cancer may best be “won” by redefining victory.



> “There are far more good historians than there are good prophets,” Klausner wrote. “It is extraordinarily difficult to predict scientific discovery, which is often propelled by seminal insights coming from unexpected directions. The classic example—Fleming’s discovery of penicillin on moldy bread and the monumental impact of that accidental finding—could not easily have been predicted, nor could the sudden demise of iron-lung technology when evolving techniques in virology allowed the growth of poliovirus and the preparation of vaccine. Any extrapolation of history into the future presupposes an environment of static discovery—an oxymoron.”



> When truly radical discoveries appear, their impact is often not incremental but cataclysmic and paradigm-shifting. Technology dissolves its own past.



> But with cancer, where no simple, universal, or definitive cure is in sight—and is never likely to be—the past is constantly conversing with the future.



> And there is a subtler reason to remember this story: while the content of medicine is constantly changing, its form, I suspect, remains astonishingly the same. History repeats, but science reverberates. The tools that we will use to battle cancer in the future will doubtless alter so dramatically in fifty years that the geography of cancer prevention and therapy might be unrecognizable.



> Her quest for a cure had taken her on a strange and limitless journey, through Internet blogs and teaching hospitals, chemotherapy and clinical trials halfway across the country, through a landscape more desolate, desperate, and disquieting than she had ever imagined.



> There is a very clear place that lies between the nihilism that has been reported in the media lately and the over-optimism—or the hype that existed thirty years ago. To lean in one direction while neglecting the other does a disservice to the progress that has been made.



> Part of my attempt with this book is to allow the public to understand the level of complexity and thereby appreciate the ingenuity and the resilience of knowledge that has come about in terms of discovery. The sequencing of the cancer genome is a good example.



> To take care of cancer patients is an enormous privilege, but it also involves deploying everything in your toolbox: the emotional, the psychological, the scientific, the epidemiologic. There’s laboratory science, history, clinical trials, and palliative medicine. Every aspect of medicine is involved, and the difference that you can make to a person’s life as an oncologist is incredible.



> It’s gotten vastly better because the prior years have been humbling, and the disciplines have become less isolated. These days, there is hardly a cancer center in which there are not collaborative groups between surgeons, chemotherapists, and radiation oncologists. I think that model evolved out of those humbling experiences—the idea that you can’t just use one weapon to battle cancer



> There are four significant areas. The first is the role of the immune system in certain kinds of cancer.



> The second area is cancer metabolism.



> The third area of interest is the role of gene regulation in cancer cells. Nearly



> The final area of promising investigation is the role of the microenvironment of cancer cells, and its relationship with growth, invasion, and metastasis.




Thinking positively does not cure!

> But there is no “correct” response to a diagnosis of cancer. I am deeply offended when people say to a patient: “you are not healing properly because you aren’t thinking positively” or “negative thoughts cause cancer—think positively.”,, This form of thinking is medieval—it blames the victim and increases the burden of illness. I know dozens of cancer patients who thought “positively”—but inevitably succumbed to a deadly variant of cancer. And I know dozens who had no “positive” response but are alive today.

Possible changes in lifestyle

> We should avoid exposure to tobacco and avoid or reduce our exposure to alcohol. We could eat low-meat, fiber-rich diets, we could avoid exposure to UV and to ionizing radiation.
